### Look at these extracts from the presentations. Decide if they are introducing (I), highlighting (H) or rephrasing (R) information.

Certainly, understanding when to classify phrases as introducing (I), highlighting (H), or rephrasing (R) can initially seem challenging, but recognizing the purpose each phrase serves in the context of data presentation can help. Here's a simplified approach to identifying these categories:

#### Introducing (I) - "Setting the Stage"
- **Key Indicators**: Look for phrases that are **used to present something new** to the audience. These often start discussions about a **new** chart, graph, or piece of information.
- **Tip**: If the phrase feels like the **beginning of a new topic** or is used to **direct attention to a new visual element** or data set, it likely serves to introduce.

#### Highlighting (H) - "Drawing Attention"
- **Key Indicators**: These phrases point out specific **details, trends, or important findings within the data**. They aim to make certain aspects stand out.
- **Tip**: If the phrase is used to **emphasize** a particular **detail**, **contrast**, or **important** result that should not be overlooked, it's highlighting.

#### Rephrasing (R) - "Clarifying or Offering a New Perspective"
- **Key Indicators**: Look for phrases that either **clarify the presented information** for better understanding or **offer a different way of looking at** the data.
- **Tip**: If the phrase **seems to simplify, clarify, or provide an alternative explanation** of the data, it's rephrasing.

#### Practice with Context
- **Introducing Context**: Imagine you're at the start of a presentation, and you say, "Let's examine the annual sales graph." You're introducing new information — the annual sales graph.
  
- **Highlighting Context**: If you then point out, "Notice the sharp increase in sales in Q3," you're highlighting a specific detail within the graph.
  
- **Rephrasing Context**: After discussing complex data, saying, "In other words, sales doubled this quarter due to our new marketing strategy," would be rephrasing the previously mentioned data for clarity.

#### Additional Tips
- **Listen for Transitions**: Phrases that introduce tend to signal a transition to a new topic or visual element.
- **Observe the Focus**: Highlighting phrases make you focus on something already presented, emphasizing its importance.
- **Seek the Clarification**: Rephrasing often comes after complex information has been given and there's a need to make it more accessible or viewed from a different angle.

By practicing with real or hypothetical data presentations and paying attention to these indicators, you'll become more adept at distinguishing between introducing, highlighting, and rephrasing phrases.
