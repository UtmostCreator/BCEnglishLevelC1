> Foreign listeners **aren’t hard of hearing or deaf**.

the use of "**aren't**"/ "**am not**" / "**isn't**" for states or conditions and "don't" for actions:

1. **"Aren't" (are not)** is used here because the sentence is describing a state of being related to the listeners. "Hard of hearing" and "deaf" are conditions or states of being. When describing someone's condition, state, or characteristics, the verb "to be" (in this case, "are") is used, followed by an adjective or a noun describing the condition. Thus, "aren't" is the correct choice.
    
2. **"Don't" (do not)** is typically used with action verbs to negate them. For example, "They don’t listen to music" would be correct because "listen" is an action verb, and "don’t" negates that action.

### Aren't (States/Conditions)

1. **They aren't happy** (state of being).
2. **The windows aren't open** (condition).
3. **We aren't related** (relationship status).

### Don't (Actions)

1. **They don't run** (action of running).
2. **We don't eat meat** (action of eating).
3. **I don't play the piano** (action of playing).

These examples underscore the distinction: use **"aren't"** to describe states, characteristics, or conditions, and **"don't"** to negate actions or habits.
