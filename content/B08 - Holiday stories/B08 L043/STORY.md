My friend has been planning, planning and one moer time planning it down to the details thourhoughly, as it was supposed to be 7 countries in one month. Having all tickets at this hand he started his journey and he departed from Cyprus to USA, and from USA he flew to Asia, and he experieced some jet lag which just affected his so much so that he spend dedicated days getting back to normal. But guess what happens next?
Then he arrived to Norway for another few days, where he got the worst accomodation ever, infested with cockroaches, feak cold weather outside. Because all other places were overbooked
He got to one of the restuarants for some food, and had some meal there. there was nothing suspicious, and the taste was quite okaish. though about 4 hours later he felt that he managed to get travellerâ€™s tummy
