## Task is to

Talk about one means of transportation that you often use. You should mention:
- Where you usually go by that means of transportation
- What the advantages and disadvantages of that method of travelling are
- And if you think you will use that means of transport more or less often in the future, and why
## Story

When telling a story think of:
- past
- current
- feature
This will help you to generate ideas, and show how a story unravels.

### give a brief introduction to let the person know what's your topic

> 1-2 sentences

1. There are many means of transportation that we can use, and **today I'd like to tell you three stories about** my experience with transportation
2. So, today I'd like to tell you three stories about my experience with transportation throughout my life

#### talking about past

Mention some points in your story:
- **What** you remember about the past experience
- **When** you first tried it or used it
- **What** you know about it

answer:
- I took bus every morning for 4 years to get to college, and it was quite long and boring journey on an old and badly maintained vehicle
- After college graduation i remember government introduced a new bus, which was inexpensive and direct to my uni, which was extremely convenient and then another 4.5 years to uni.
- Even though, i liked newly introduced bus, there was a better way to travel, it was a tram, fast and very comfy, much more space, and almost always on time. Unfortunately, it was quite a distance away from me, and my friends. I had only a few chances to use it, but those memories will never go away.
#### talking about present

- Why did you start using this?
- What do you like about this?

From now on, I am going to cover my current situation with transportation. In the recent years, I have tried many different means of PT, and I see adv. and disadv. for each of them, but the most attractive is still for me is to use trains. There is nothing more than travel by train anywhere they go to. As you may have already understood that trains can't go anywhere you want, but busses can, in most cases. When I am in the city with subway, it is always a priority for me to use, as it allows you to get from point A to point B having no issues in time or staying still in congested roads, and in this meantime - when you travel, you can read books, sometimes work if you have space and a table. 

### talking about feature

 I'm entirely convinced that it is the feature, as cars, and buses can not travel as fast as trains, and new trains has proven that it is more environment friendly, and it can carry more passangers.
