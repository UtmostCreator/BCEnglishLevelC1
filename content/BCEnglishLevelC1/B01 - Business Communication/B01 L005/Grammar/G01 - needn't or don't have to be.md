> a contract of employment (**needn't be** / **don't have to**) reduced to writing.

The correct phrase to use in this context is "needn't be." So, the sentence would be:

"A contract of employment **needn't be** reduced to writing."

The phrase "needn't be" is used to indicate that something is not necessary. In this context, it means that it's not required for a contract of employment to be written down or formalized in a document. This can vary depending on legal requirements in different jurisdictions, but the phrase suggests that a formal, written document is not a necessity for the contract to be considered valid.

"Don't have to" could also be used in casual contexts with a similar meaning, but "needn't be" is more formal and is more likely to be found in written guidelines or legal contexts. Thus, "needn't be" is the preferable choice in this case.
