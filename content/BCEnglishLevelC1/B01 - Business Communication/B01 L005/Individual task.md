I'm going to talk about dress code policy in companies
First of all i will go through all do's and then I'll go over all dont's
Regularly review the code because it does imapcts everyone, and must be tidy so everyone else can change and understand it
Think about const-implication for employees when buying tech things(pc/phones), and so on, state in your contract that itmust be retured back to a company as it is a companies asset

that's all id like to say about donts now.


Now we'll move on to..

That's all I'd like to say about do's and dont's

To conclude
