## Not at All

- **Usage**: This phrase is commonly used to respond to expressions of gratitude or apologies, indicating that something was no trouble or to strongly negate a statement.
- **Context Example**: After helping someone, if they say "Thank you so much!" you might reply, "Not at all!" to imply it was no trouble. Or, if someone asks if you're bothered by something, saying "Not at all" indicates you're completely unbothered.

## Not in the Least

- **Usage**: Similar to "not at all," but it can sound a bit more formal. It's used to emphasize a total lack of something, often knowledge, concern, or impact.
- **Context Example**: In response to a question like "Are you worried about the changes?" replying with "Not in the least" emphasizes that you have absolutely no worries.

**When to Use**:

- **"Not at all"** is versatile and commonly used in casual and formal speech to negate something fully or express that something is no problem.
- **"Not in the least"** serves a similar function but might be chosen for emphasis or in slightly more formal or emphatic contexts.

Both phrases are effective for strong negation, with "not at all" being slightly more common in everyday use, while "not in the least" might be preferred for added emphasis or formality.
