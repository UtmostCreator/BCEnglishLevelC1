In this lesson you will discuss various theories proposed to some notorious scientific puzzles and reach agreement on the most plausible. You will listen to a typical radio magazine programme about unsolved scientific mysteries and practise the language for speculating about the past, expressing opinions and giving reasons for them.

It is still and always has been my belief that

must - it is almost certain that something happened
might - it is possible that something happened or was true
need not - it is possible that something **did not** happen
cannot - it is not possible that something happened


- Easter Island is very isolated. The Islanders were dependent solely on the natural resources of the island.
	- _If Easter Island wasn’t so isolated, the islanders wouldn’t have been dependent solely on the natural resources of the island._
- Climate change did not affect the Easter Islanders. There is no evidence of it.
	- If climate change had affected the Easter Islanders, there would be evidence for it
- The Easter Islanders decimated the forests. They couldn’t continue to build timber houses or canoes.
	- Had the Easter Islanders not decimated the forest, they could have continued to build timber houses and canoes.
- There is no generally accepted theory about Easter Island. That is why we are still fascinated.
	- if there was a generally accepted theory about Easter Island, we wouldn't all still be fascinated by it.


1. The Easter Island statues are huge. It **must have taken** a long time to carve one.
2. The Easter Island statues weigh tonnes. A lot of people **must have been** involved in moving them.
3. The Islanders **can't have moved** the statues by carrying them. They were too heavy.
4. They **might have transported** the stones using ropes. It is at least possible.
5. Islanders said the statues ‘walked’; this **could have meant** that they were moved in an upright position.
6. They **may not have moved** all the statues in the same way. Perhaps it depended on the distance.
7. Archaeologists have found human bones so the Islanders **must have buried** their dead around the statues.
8. They also have found red pigment which **may have been** used to paint the statues.
