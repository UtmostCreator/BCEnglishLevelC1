Roman confidently declared: "We have everything planned down to the last detail. So we should have no troubles doing this heist, and the change for a success is so high."

Oksana added, "Good, bro. My friend Eugenia works as a teller in the bank, and she will assist us because she has the combination to the vault. So, we had no issues getting into the vault immediately."

Eugenia gives more details to our plan as we go: "You know, A tiny blue van is a getaway point for us today, and it is waiting just around the corner for us As we have been monitoring this bank branch meticulously, and noticed that there are times when 2 policemen with dogs, two Rottweilers, patrolling the nearby area every even day, so and we have prepared for that. We strategically placed sleeping pills into small pieces of food for the dogs, reducing the possibility to be detected, and to make our presence less visible, this way we medized any risk of arousing suspicion. Our heist was meticulously scheduled for a day that best suited our secret plan. And we took everyone by surprise so no one managed to react to it"

Another accomplice poured petrol, signaling their readiness for every contingency.

After we managed to exit the bank with 7,000 gold ingots. And after we came back to our warehouse, we realized that we had stolen all the gold jewellery made in the UK.

20 years later, an insider came forward to the police, leaving the government confused, as the stolen treasure had never been recovered before this insider's confession.
