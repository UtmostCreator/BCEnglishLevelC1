# Lesson 1

## ex1
You will hear three speakers offering advice about giving presentations to international audiences. Listen and choose the main point each person makes.


Speaker 1
`Make sure the audience can follow you.`

Speaker 2
`Don't assume anything.`

Speaker 3
`Don't make jokes.`

## ex2
Listen again. Complete the notes using ONE word for each gap.
Speaker 1

Start by explaining the
structure
 of your talk to the audience. When referring to numbers and
dates
, speak slowly and clearly. Don't use sarcasm or irony, which don't work well with international audiences. Continually check whether audiences are clear about what you are saying or would like you to
elaborate
 anything.

Speaker 2

Although it's important not to assume audiences can understand everything you say, do not speak
loudly
 as this could cause offence. Not all nationalities will give you
applause
 at the end of a good presentation. For example,
German
 audiences might hit the table and Japanese audiences might remain in
silence
. Avoid using too many gestures or visual aids, which may be
distracting
.

Speaker 3

Make sure that the pace of your delivery is not too
fast
, to avoid losing your crowd. Using slang and jokes can be a mistake. Appreciating humour, especially, depends on a
cultural
 mindset.

Speaker 1

[Tom, young professional from UK]

The first thing I do when I start a talk is tell them the structure of the whole thing. For example, I’ll explain at the beginning that I’m gonna talk about X, then Y, then Z. I think two things that are especially relevant to international presentations are, one, say numbers and dates slowly and, two, don’t use sarcasm or irony. Even if you know your audience’ll understand 99% of what you’re saying, you’ve got to be careful with numbers because even as native speakers we say them differently. For example, in the States they say ‘fifteen hundred’ but I’d say ‘one thousand five hundred’. Or in India, they say ‘lakh’ instead of ‘one hundred thousand’. Avoid sarcasm, it just doesn’t travel and needs too much brain work for it to be understood. But the main thing is, make sure your listeners are following you throughout the whole presentation. If they’re not following you, they’ll just switch off and not understand anything, or worse, they’ll start chatting. A good speaker uses verification loops, basically checking all the way through that they’re still with you, like ‘Is everything clear up to now?’ or ‘Would you like me to elaborate?’ They might not always take you up on your offer but at least you’ve given them a chance.

Speaker 2

[Emma, young professional from UK]

In my experience of giving presentations all over the world, the best piece of advice I can give you is ‘Don’t assume anything’. For example, just because people in your audience may not speak English well, it doesn’t mean that they won’t understand you. If you speak really loudly, they might take offence. Foreign listeners aren’t hard of hearing or deaf. Also, you might assume that applause is a universal sign of approval. Not necessarily. In German speaking countries, your audience might rap their knuckles on the table after your presentation. In Bulgaria, nodding your head means ‘no’ and in most Asian countries, listeners will greet your presentation with absolute silence. The person should use gesture but not too much ’cause it’s distracting. Visual aids can also be distracting.

Speaker 3

[Jane, young professional from UK]

Last month I was in Berlin giving a presentation to directors from all over the world. I was doing my best to speak clearly, not mumbling, and even though I was a bit nervous, I tried really hard not to speak super fast. If your delivery is too fast, they just get lost, so you need to have the right pace. I added a few jokes and slang to liven it up a bit because they were looking kind of uninterested. Big mistake! They didn’t all understand my jokes so some laughed and some didn’t. Those poor people who didn’t, looked puzzled. Thinking about it now, only those who had lived in England understood them. I think humour is based on a deep understanding of cultural mindset, added to that, some things that may be funny to people in my culture might be crude in other cultures. So, yeah, I’m definitely not going to try to be funny any more. Also, I’m not sure slang should be used in cross-cultural presentations. The meaning of it’s always changing. If I can’t keep up, I can’t expect a non-native crowd to keep up.

## ex4

Choose the word / phrase that does not normally go with the keyword.
INCORRECT:
1. **make a talk** - провести выступление
2. **open your audience** - завоевать аудиторию
3. **TV speaker** - телеведущий
4. **make offence** - вызвать обиду
5. **cold applause** - холодные аплодисменты (refers to applause that lacks warmth or enthusiasm)
6. **full gesture** - полный жест

## ex5

A few years ago I heard a scientist give a talk about acoustics in schools.
or
A few years ago I heard a scientist gave a talk about acoustics in schools.


The correct sentence is:
"A few years ago I heard a scientist give a talk about acoustics in schools."

In this sentence, "give" is used in its base form (infinitive) because it follows the verb "heard." When using the structure "hear someone do something," the verb following "heard" should be in the base form. Therefore, "give" is correct, not "gave."



# LESSON 2

#ex1
Listen to two managers, Sarah and Henry, discussing a new recruit, Pablo, who is not fitting in well with the team. Choose the TWO correct answers for each question.
Pablo is silent and uncommunicative.
Sarah does not know what Pablo is thinking.


What possible reasons do they give for Pablo's behaviour?
He may be frightened of saying the wrong thing.
He could be concealing aggression.

How do they plan to deal with Pablo?
Sarah could ask open-ended questions.
Sarah could reassure him that she's interested in his responses.


## ex2

Listen again. Complete the notes using up to THREE words for each gap.
Do I get an answer? No! He
just tends to
 grunt, or give a ‘no’ or ‘yes’ or more likely say nothing at all.
 When she comes in, she'll
tell you
 everything that happened to her that morning, in the most minute detail – she never shuts up.
 Monica is very needy. She has
an intense fear
 of rejection.
 Some ‘clams’ feel that no one
will suspect
 how unprepared or how stupid they are, if they keep their mouths shut.
 He might have
an enormous need
 to be in control at all times.
 The others are always telling me he’s not pulling his weight, that he’s not joining in, but
they won't say
 anything to him.
 Hmm ... he might just
keep on ignoring
 me.


pessimists - They might feel they will be blamed if anything goes wrong.
panickers - They may be confused and over-whelmed.
angry, bitter people - It’s likely they aren’t just having a bad day, they are having a bad life.
hostile co-workers - You may remind them of a difficult person in their past.
people who can't say 'no' - They may have an enormous need for approval.
show-offs - They may be defending their ego and self-esteem.
nit-pickers - They may feel if they don’t look out for errors, no one else will.
passive people - They could feel ignored and that no one has listened to them.
dogmatic people - They probably need to hold tightly to their beliefs to feel comfortable.
bullying bosses - They may be caught up in a role that requires them to act like that.

d. As I am sure you know there is a raft of legislation which
prohibits
 discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, so
make sure
 this is communicated to your employees.

e. I
would also advise you
 to have a clear policy on dress ... and to
insist on
 reasonable standards of hygiene.

f. Remember that employees
have the right to
 take time off to deal with a domestic emergency and that care-givers
are entitled to
 unpaid leave in certain circumstances.

g. Maternity and paternity leave
is guaranteed by law
 and you
cannot refuse it
 to employees.
8.2
... You should also make sure employees are given a copy of the Company’s Handbook and that this includes an account of your grievance procedure which must conform to legal requirements. I would also recommend scheduling the new employee’s first performance appraisal towards the end of the probation period, so that you can deal with issues promptly. Let’s look now at my second point – workplace rules.

It’s a good idea to have a realistic policy on making and receiving personal phone calls, use of social media and the Internet, as well as downloading software or computer games. At the very least, employees should be discouraged from using company mobiles for personal calls. You can carry out itemised spot checks to establish the level of mobile use. As a minimum, you need to inform your employees that criticising the company, its products, or customers and other employees online may amount to an offence in law. On a related point you may be liable for breaches of copyright by your employees so it is advisable to restrict use of materials from the Internet. Finally, all enclosed working spaces in the UK are required to be smoke-free, including company vehicles. You are therefore obliged to ensure compliance.

The next issue I’d like to focus on is inappropriate conduct. It’s imperative to have a stated policy on antisocial behaviour in the workplace, if you want to minimise the risk of a lawsuit. You should make sure that persistent rudeness, use of foul language or comments of a sexual nature are treated as a disciplinary offence. As I am sure you know there is a raft of legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, so make sure this is communicated to your employees. I would also advise you to have a clear policy on dress especially where this is necessary for health and safety reasons or where staff regularly interact with the public and to insist on reasonable standards of hygiene. Finally, I don’t need to remind you, that incidents of violence, fraud and the possession of drugs are always regarded as gross misconduct and may be grounds for instant dismissal.

Now, I’d like to turn to absences. You cannot require people to come to work if they are ill, but you do have the right to require a medical certificate after three days’ self-certified sick leave and you are not obliged to continue paying absentees beyond the Statutory Sick Pay limits. If you do not have flexible hours, you should make sure late-comers communicate this in advance and report to their managers on arrival. Remember that employees have the right to take time off to deal with a domestic emergency and that care-givers are entitled to unpaid leave in certain circumstances. Maternity and paternity leave is guaranteed by law and you cannot refuse it to employees.

own: This intensifies possessive adjectives. (It was my own initiative).

very ... indeed: This can be used to intensify adjectives. (It was very rewarding indeed.)

auxiliary do: This can emphasise the verb and is stressed in speech. It is often used in polite forms. (I do hope I’ll be seriously considered for the job.)

not at all / not in the least: These emphasise not. (I wasn’t at all put off by the level of challenge/I wasn’t in the least put off by the level of challenge)

at all / whatsoever: These emphasise no and none. (I didn’t have any problems at all/I had no problem whatsoever)

even + comparative: This emphasises the comparative. (She admitted things are bad, but argues they were even worse under the previous government.)


1 Keep the channels of communication open. It may sound like a basic point, but taking the time to converse with employees and tell them they are doing a good job can make them feel more appreciated and motivated to make a positive contribution. Regular feedback and encouragement doesn't have to be formalised - just having a chat shows employees that they are personally valued.

2 Take a pro-active approach to employee well-being. Poor health and long hours lead to reduced productivity. Apart from encouraging people to take a break, many companies have tackled long- term absence and high staff turnover by offering programmes such as office yoga and pilates, discounted gym membership or free flu jabs. Others provide health screening and carry out awareness campaigns on different themes, such as cancer, giving up smoking or dealing with stress.

3 Involve your team in decision-making. Forming problem-solving groups to generate new ideas about improving working practices, cutting costs and bettering the competition, can help employees feel more empowered and motivated. When employees feel ownership of the business or organisation, they are more motivated to perform at a higher standard.

4 Offer training and development. Employees recognise the importance of honing their skills and developing new ones, so as to not to stagnate in the workplace. High turnover of staff is often due to lack of development opportunities, at the same time, unproductive workers may remain where they are because they don't have the skill set to move on.

5 Provide a clear career path. Employees need definite roles and the potential to move up the ranks of the organisation, if they choose. If there are few opportunities for promotion or you recruit mainly from outside the organisation, this has an overall negative impact on employees motivation.

6 Organise social gatherings. You can enhance team spirit by providing regular scheduled social activities, whether bowling, Christmas parties or visits to a restaurant. This helps to create a positive working environment by encouraging staff to see each other as individuals, not just co-workers.

7 Promise time off. Salary increases or annual bonuses are not always the best way to motivate staff. In many cases, people prefer time-off to cash in hand. Having reached targets, they can be rewarded with extra holiday, or later arrivals, earlier dismissals or extended lunch periods.

8 Praise promptly. When an employee has done something valuable, they should be recognised on the spot. Don't put it off until the moment has passed. Equally, if an employee has put in a significant amount of extra work, a simple thank you may not be enough. Recognition might involve sending an email to all departments, or paying a special visit to the employee.

9 Give people extra responsibility. There are always people in any organisation with leadership ability. You should identify them and make sure you match their skills to the roles that would suit them best. Allow people to take the spotlight, if that is what they want to do and have the potential to make a good team leader.

10 Make the working environment attractive. A recent survey showed that this is the number 2 factor in employees sense of wellbeing at work. Working conditions are that important. Make sure your employees have an environment they feel comfortable in and which they can personalise, if need be, adding their own touches from home


So, let me try and give a brief summary of
how the two systems differ
.

Overall I’d say there are probably more
differences than similarities
 between them, though having said that, the actual structure of progression through the years and at what age
isn't that dissimilar
.

The
most obvious difference
 is the names we use, which can be confusing.

And they refer to the last two years at high school as ‘the sixth form’
whereas the American equivalent would be
 ‘twelfth grade’ or ‘senior year’ I guess.

The
main difference is that
 we have middle school, which I believe is unusual in Britain,
otherwise
 it’s
broadly similar in terms of
 your years at school.

The exams and tests are
significantly different
.

The nearest thing we've got to
 GCSEs is the high school diploma, but that doesn’t tell anyone how much you know about different subjects, just that you successfully completed high school.

And we don’t have anything that
corresponds to
 A-levels
as such
, which is
a huge difference
.


Each episode of the show follows a
broadly
 similar storyline - they find a dead body in horrible circumstances and then get involved in solving the mystery.

My sister isn’t really that
dissimilar
 to me in personality, though we’re completely different physically.

Eye witness accounts often
differ
 from each other to a remarkable degree.

English words and phrases that have no
equivalent
 in another language can present a problem to language learners.

For many lonely old people, the
nearest
 thing they have to a friend is a cat or a dog.

The north of the country is mountainous and can be very cold,
whereas
 the south is flat with a more temperate climate.

Broadly speaking, the US Congress
corresponds
 to the British Parliament.

American football and rugby must have evolved from the same origins - there are so many
obvious
 similarities between the two sports.

We are entering a new phase of the company’s development and we need to adopt a
significantly
 different approach.


 So, let me try and give a brief summary of how the two systems differ. Overall I’d say there are probably more differences than similarities between them, though having said that, the actual structure of progression through the years and at what age isn’t that dissimilar. The most obvious difference is the names we use, which can be confusing. We say ‘public school’ and the British say ‘state school’, and we say ‘college’ or ‘school’ when we mean what the British call ‘university’. And they refer to the last two years at high school as ‘the sixth form’ whereas the American equivalent would be ‘twelfth grade’ or ‘senior year’ I guess. The main difference is that we have middle school, which I believe is unusual in Britain, otherwise it’s broadly similar in terms of your years at school.

The exams and tests are significantly different. The nearest thing we’ve got to GCSEs is the high school diploma, but that doesn’t tell anyone how much you know about different subjects, just that you successfully completed high school. And we don’t have anything that corresponds to A-levels as such, which is a huge difference. To get into college (university that is) Americans do a standardised test – either ACT or SAT [pronounced ‘a.c.t’ and ‘s.a.t’ - not as words] both of which test logical reasoning and problem solving and literacy, whereas A-levels test specific subjects like Geography or Spanish. And the US colleges also look at something called GPA, which is an average of your grades all through high school. So there are two really substantial differences. The first is that American colleges aren’t looking at what you already know about, for example Physics or Medieval History, but at your aptitude and general level of education, which means that American high school students don’t have to specialise in the same way as British A-level students do. And secondly, American students’ chances of getting into a good college don’t just depend on the results of one set of exams, unlike British students where only A-level results count. Of course, the drawback of the American system is that if you had a bad couple of years when you were fourteen or fifteen it can be hard to get your average back up.

Which brings me on to the differences at college / university level. Students don’t specialise in the same way as they do in Britain. In your first and second years at a US college you do introductory courses in a wide range of subjects: humanities, philosophy, theology, sciences, languages. Requirements at different colleges may differ, but you definitely don’t go to college to do History and nothing else as happens in Britain. It’s quite normal to find someone studying to be a theoretical physicist and they’re doing a course in philosophy or literature. To me it makes sense and I think it’s a real strength of the American system. Scientists should know about literature and historians should be able to do math. In Britain, as far as I know, if you’re doing a literature major, then you almost certainly won’t be doing any science classes and vice versa. On the plus side though, it’s a lot cheaper to go to a British university than an American college – we pay significantly more in fees, and most undergraduate degrees take four years rather than three.

And of course, there’s a lot of focus on sport at American colleges. Compared to the UK, college sport is a huge business, broadcast on prime time TV. Colleges fight to give scholarships to the best athletes. I don’t think there’s any equivalent to that in Britain.

Read the article. Put the topics in the order they are mentioned.
Summerhill School

Summerhill School is a co-educational boarding school on the east coast of England founded in 1921 by A.S. Neill, a Scottish writer and educationalist, whose daughter Zoe Readhead is the current principal. Summerhill was one of the earliest schools to offer an alternative to mainstream education via what has become known as democratic or ‘free’ schooling. Neill’s vision was to put into practice new theories not only of education, but also of parenting based on the concept of freedom of choice for the child and so engender self-confidence, a sense of responsibility, consideration for others and tolerance. Housed in a beautiful Victorian building in the middle of the Suffolk countryside, the school is home to a thriving community of approximately seventy-five children aged between five and seventeen and twenty-five adults.

All decisions about the internal running of the school, including rules and what to do with those who break them, are made at the school meetings, held twice weekly, at which everyone, regardless of age or status has an equal right to be heard and an equal role to play in the decision-making. There are about 170 rules in place, agreed by the meeting including ‘no watching TV during the day’, ‘no graffiti outside of the graffiti wall’ and ‘respect quiet time after 10.30 at night’, while a penalty might be a fine either to be paid from pocket money or in the form of a period of work doing something for the good of the community. The school has other expectations of reasonable conduct, including a no-bullying policy, also democratically agreed. Staff do not impose their values on the children. Children are free to develop their moral and ethical values at their own pace and can take on roles of responsibility in the school community when they are ready.

Parental involvement is not encouraged at the school as parents may force their own agendas on their children, such as pushing for good exam results for example, instead of leaving them free to set their own goals. School reports are only sent to parents if they are needed for admission purposes in another school or college, and even then, only with the child’s permission.

In terms of the curriculum, the school offers a wide range of subjects up to GCSE level. Apart from the usual formal subjects such as History, Maths or a foreign language, other classes are offered at the children’s request. Some recent examples are gardening, magic lessons, chess and bug study. Children also have the use of the wide range of sports facilities over the 12-acre site and free access to art and woodwork facilities and computers.

Absolutely central to the school’s approach is the belief that children should be completely free to play, whenever they like and as much as they like. For this reason, all classes are optional. Children ‘sign up’ at the beginning of term for the classes that they want to attend, so structuring their own timetables. There is no minimum number of classes or compulsory attendance, or imposed assessment. Talking to friends or playing games is seen as equally important in the ongoing process of education. Newcomers to the school have often come because they are not doing well in mainstream education for whatever reason, and have often been labelled as ‘difficult’. Such a child may spend a year not attending classes, but sooner or later, when they are ready, will start to participate.

Inside the classroom, the teaching style is relatively traditional, the explanation being that as children are choosing to attend a class, there is no necessity for the teacher to bend over backwards to engage their interest. For the same reason, behaviour in the classroom is seldom a problem.

The school has been the focus of some controversies over the years, being nicknamed the ‘doas- yer-like’ school, and has been involved in more than one skirmish with an Education Minister. Be that as it may, the school has survived with its reputation intact. There are now hundreds of democratic schools in countries all around the world and Neill’s books have influenced generations of teachers and parents.

“We set out to make a school in which we should allow children freedom to be themselves. In order to do this we had to renounce all discipline, all direction, all suggestion, all moral training, all religious instruction. We have been called brave, but it did not require courage. All it required was what we had – a complete belief in the child as a good, not an evil, being.”

Nowadays, many people criticise politicians for using
spin
 to dress up information to make it more appealing to the public.

The scandal only came to light when
a whistle-blower
 in the Home Office made an anonymous call to the Press.

The government is too eager
to cosy up
 to big business, in the hopes of obtaining their support.

The Minister is attempting
to deflect
 rumours of financial impropriety by focusing on the government’s record on law and order.

The Prime Minister was quick
to deny
 allegations that the government had sought to interfere with the judicial process.

Several officials have been convicted of
illicit
 phone-hacking in order to listen in to their opponents’ conversations.

He was accused of masterminding a
dirty tricks
 campaign against the opposition party at the last election.

The magazine says that there appears to be hard evidence of a government
cover-up
 to conceal the full extent of the scandal.

This administration has been characterised by financial and sexual
sleaze
, blatant hypocrisy, bribery and corruption.

Most big media outlets have murky ownership, leaving their journalists vulnerable to outside pressure and
influence-peddling
.


Сегодня многие критикуют политиков за то, что они используют пропаганду, чтобы приукрасить информацию и сделать ее более привлекательной для общественности. Скандал стал известен только тогда, когда осведомитель из Министерства внутренних дел анонимно позвонил в прессу. Правительство слишком стремится сблизиться с крупным бизнесом в надежде получить его поддержку. Министр пытается опровергнуть слухи о финансовых нарушениях, сосредоточив внимание на действиях правительства в области закона и порядка. Премьер-министр поспешил опровергнуть обвинения в том, что правительство пыталось вмешаться в судебный процесс. Несколько чиновников были признаны виновными в незаконном взломе телефонов с целью прослушивания разговоров своих оппонентов. Его обвинили в организации грязной кампании против оппозиционной партии на последних выборах. Журнал сообщает, что, судя по всему, существуют веские доказательства того, что правительство скрывает весь масштаб скандала. Эта администрация характеризуется финансовой и сексуальной подлостью, вопиющим лицемерием, взяточничеством и коррупцией. Большинство крупных СМИ имеют неясную собственность, что делает их журналистов уязвимыми для внешнего давления и торговли влиянием.


Thanks for having me on the show, John. Yes, you’re right, public opinion has been affected by media cover of various political scandals over the years. People have become wary of politicians’ use of
spin
 to dress up information and make it more appealing. Indeed, people often remark that politicians are too eager
to cosy up to
 big business, in the hopes of obtaining their support. Likewise, people are very much aware that, in the past, politicians have attempted
to deflect
 rumours of financial impropriety or have sought
to deny
 allegations relating to interference with the judicial process. Public opinion has been swayed by stories of
illicit
 phone-hacking and
dirty tricks
 campaigns against opposition parties. Now, the current administration has been characterised by
sleaze
 hypocrisy and corruption. But will coverage of this new scandal and the hard evidence of a government
cover-up
 to conceal its full extent completely change the public’s perception of the party? What do you think John?


Спасибо, что пригласили меня на шоу, Джон. Да, вы правы, на общественное мнение повлияло освещение в СМИ различных политических скандалов на протяжении многих лет. Люди стали настороженно относиться к тому, что политики используют "спин", чтобы приукрасить информацию и сделать ее более привлекательной. Действительно, люди часто отмечают, что политики слишком охотно идут на поводу у крупного бизнеса, надеясь заручиться его поддержкой. Точно так же люди прекрасно понимают, что в прошлом политики пытались отмахнуться от слухов о финансовых нарушениях или опровергнуть обвинения во вмешательстве в судебный процесс. Общественное мнение было поколеблено историями о незаконном телефонном хакерстве и кампаниях грязных трюков против оппозиционных партий. Нынешняя администрация характеризуется лицемерием и коррупцией. Но изменит ли освещение этого нового скандала и неопровержимые доказательства того, что правительство скрывает все его масштабы, восприятие партии обществом? Что вы думаете, Джон?

Crime violates the laws of a community, state or nation. It is punishable in accordance with these laws. The definition of crime varies according to time and place, but the laws of most countries consider as crimes such offences as arson, treason ,burglary, forgery and murder.  Not all offences against the law are crimes . The laws that set down punishments for crimes form the criminal law .

The common law recognizes three classes of crime: treason, felony and misdemeanour. Death or life imprisonment is the usual penalty  for treason. Laws in the United States, for example, define a felony as a crime that is punishable by a term of one year or more in a state or federal prison . A person who commits a misdemeanour may be punished by a fine or a jail term of less than one year.

About us

(1)
The Primrose Trust is a charitable organisation with humanitarian goals.
 Our key aim is to support research that benefits the public good. We seek to prevent, cure and alleviate disease and disability by providing funding for vital medical research.

The beginnings

The Primrose Trust was founded by Henry and Louisa Primrose in 1928 to commemorate the safe birth of their triplets Violet, Alma and Julia. Their motivation was to share their good fortune at a time when multiple births were dangerous, and the odds of survival were low. Henry was a successful businessman who saw that medical research needed to be separated from the companies that stood to gain financially from it.

(2)
His vision has been carried forward by subsequent generations.
 Over the years, funding has been given to such groundbreaking projects as keyhole surgery, antibiotics and vaccination. Future advances will be even more exciting.

Prime objectives

(3)
We believe that we have to prioritise to make the maximum impact.
 The Primrose Trust has three prime objectives:

to provide starter funding – many promising research projects may be simply too cutting edge to attract government grants. Relatively inexpensive seedcorn funding can lead to additional grants from major organisations.
to encourage bright ideas – some of the best insights into ways to improve existing procedures and treatments are gained during a clinician’s everyday work, even if not specifically engaged in research. Funding is almost impossible to obtain in such circumstances.
maximum impact – we support wide-reaching projects that have the potential to benefit large numbers affected by disease and disability, either in the short or long term.
Success stories

(4)
This is a very exciting time.
 Medical research is progressing at a fast pace and prospects for major advances are brighter than they have ever been. Provision of well-targeted funding can make a significant difference and charitable institutions such as The Primrose Trust are invaluable in this process.

Here are some of the exciting research areas we have given our backing to in recent years:

developing vaccines against tumours
gene therapy for certain leukaemias
modifications of surgical procedures to improve patient comfort and care
techniques for regenerating damaged nerves which may enable the paralysed to move again
Why donate to The Primrose Trust?

The biggest constraint on medical research outside of the big drug companies is lack of funds. There are many world-class researchers wasting valuable time competing for the limited funds available – there is simply not enough money to go round. This is where private charitable organisations such as The Primrose Trust have such a vital role to play, and we are committed to helping. We have almost a hundred years of experience in seeking out the most exciting research projects and carefully evaluating, monitoring and supporting them.
(5)
We are fully confident in saying that that our research is both innovative and of a high standard.
  Our expertise in this area means that your money is 100% guaranteed to go to reliable, peer-reviewed research projects – and 100% of your donation is guaranteed to go directly to medical research.
