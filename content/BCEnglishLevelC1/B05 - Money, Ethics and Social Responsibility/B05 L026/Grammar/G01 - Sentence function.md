1. **Rhetorical Question**: It's like asking a question when you don't really expect an answer. Imagine asking, "Who doesn't love ice cream?" not to get an answer but to make a point.
2. **Repetition**: It's repeating the same word or idea like a favorite song chorus that gets stuck in your head. It's like saying, "Study, study, study to ace that test!"
3. **Personalisation**: This means talking directly to you, making you feel like part of the story. Imagine a story that starts with, "Imagine you're a superhero..."
4. **Powerful Descriptive Language**: Using words that paint a vivid picture in your mind, like describing a sunset as "a sky ablaze with fiery oranges and pinks."
5. **Talking Directly to the Listener**: It's like when someone looks right at you and speaks to you, making you feel involved and important.
6. **Being Specific About What to Do**: This is like giving clear instructions, such as "Click the big red button," so you know exactly what to do without guessing.
