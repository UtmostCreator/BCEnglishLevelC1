## ex2 - 21st century business writing

Business writing is driven by technology. Texts need to be **conversational** and **concise**
People typically have less time to read their messages so your writing needs to be **engaging**  and **memorable**. Finally, gaps created by time zones, **locations** and generations required teams to **collaborate** seamlessly.
## ex3 - Memorable messages

| Use colours and formatting that make your document come alive.          | Select the most relevant information based on your audience needs. | Use a friendly tone with the use of ‘I’ and ‘we’.                                    |
| Use images, graphs, charts and infographics that ‘speak’ to the reader. |                                                                    | Use short sentences, active verbs, vocabulary that the reader will be familiar with. |
