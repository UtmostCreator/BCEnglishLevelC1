`I wouldn't have been afraid of the water. `
It refers to a hypothetical past situation and its past consequence. The use of "wouldn't have been" suggests that, had you learned to swim, the fear of water would not have existed or been an issue at a specific past time or period.
vs
`**I wouldn't be afraid of the water**`
you would not currently have a fear of water. This structure suggests a lasting or ongoing condition—your fear of water—that would have been prevented by learning to swim.

- If you aim to express that learning to swim would have prevented a fear of water at a specific time in the past, use the first sentence.
- If you want to emphasize that learning to swim in the past would mean you would not now be afraid of water, use the second sentence. This latter form is more common when discussing current attitudes or states that could have been affected by past actions.

## 3 didn't mess vs hadn't messed | woodwork

If I didn't mess around in woodwork classes, I could make my own furniture.
vs 
⭐️If I hadn't messed around in woodwork classes, I could make my own furniture.



`**If I didn't mess around in **`
However, it's slightly off in terms of conventional conditional structure for expressing hypothetical situations affecting the present. A more grammatically typical way to express a general, ongoing hypothetical condition would involve the present tense, such as "If I don't mess around in woodwork classes, I could make my own furniture," implying that if you were currently taking woodwork classes and not messing around, you might be able to make your own furniture.
vs

`**If I hadn't messed around in**`


The second sentence is correctly structured to express regret about past behavior (messing around in woodwork classes) and its negative impact on your present abilities. It effectively communicates a missed opportunity to acquire a valuable skill due to past actions.


the main clause ("I could make my own furniture") diverges slightly from the traditional third conditional formula because it uses "could" followed by the base form of the verb ("make") instead of "could have" followed by a past participle. This structure implies a present ability that could have been achieved based on a different past action.



## regret to/

CORRECT:
I regret not learning **to** carry out basic home maintenance when I lived with my parents.
INCORRECT:I regret not learning `[to]` carry out basic home maintenance when I lived with my parents.


However, in your sentence, there seems to be a missing "to" before "carry out," which is necessary to form the infinitive phrase that specifies what you regret not learning. The corrected sentence should read:


## the bus VS a bus

1. **"I wish the bus would come, as I'm freezing."**
    
    - This sentence, with "the bus," implies that there's a specific bus the speaker is waiting for. It suggests that the speaker knows which bus they expect to arrive, perhaps because it's the one they usually take or because it's the only one that serves their route at that time.
2. **"I wish a bus would come, as I'm freezing."**
    
    - Using "a bus" with the indefinite article indicates that the speaker is not waiting for any specific bus. They just want any bus to arrive so they can get out of the cold. This phrasing is more about the desire for transport, in general, to escape the uncomfortable situation, rather than the arrival of a particular service.
