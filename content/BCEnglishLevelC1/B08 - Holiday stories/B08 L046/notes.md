What I don't understand is how people put up with  such horrible products in their stores, if i were the person who can change it, I would have removed 60% plus of the food from the shelves.
it is likely that with existing attitudes
to food within the UK will change people , and hey won't be living a long and happy lives.
It could be the case that only those people who understand it will have saved more of the health by the time ultra processed food will cover the entire UK market which is happening right now.
if more wise people were in goverment, it wouldn't have happened.
The feasibility is unclear on how it could be solved in the nearest future.
