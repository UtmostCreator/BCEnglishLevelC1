### ex3 - An appeal to save endangered species

1. The majestic snow leopard roams through the harshest winter known to man in the Himalayas, and other mountainous regions of Central Asia, but **for how much longer**?
2. The shy, retiring orang-utan is **recognizable by its characteristic coloring**, high intelligence, and endearing features.
3. The gentle giant of the sub-tropical rainforests of Borneo **faces extinction on an unprecedented scale**.
4. **It faces a two-fold threat**, primarily from illegal and unsustainable logging which is destroying its **fragile habitat**, but also from poaching of adults and capture of babies for the illegal pet trade.
5. **Are you willing to stand idly by** and watch the dramatic decline of both these species?
6. Only **with your help can this be halted**.
7. We urgently need **donations to fund the ongoing** conservation projects.
8. Please call 0800 234 7616 or follow the link on our web page, to **preserve these animals for future generations**.
