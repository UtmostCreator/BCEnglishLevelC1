> The Thomas-Kilmann Instrument (TKI) measures a person’s behaviour in conflict situations. It defines five distinct approaches for handling conflict. Identify and prioritise needs and wants in your conflict situation and use this model to help you select an appropriate approach.

Behaviour is described along two dimensions.
**assertiveness**: the extent to which the person attempts to satisfy their own needs; 
**cooperativeness**: the extent to which the person attempts to satisfy the other party’s needs.
The **collaborate** approach is often the most ideal, but sometimes it is not possible. We may need to **avoid** the other person for a while to gather more information before we decide what to do next. If we don’t have the authority to make decisions or influence a situation, we may have to 
accommodate. 
Sometimes, policies or regulations mean that we have to **compete**. 
The **compromise** approach can be used if you can’t think of creative solutions.

### Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI)

The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (**TKI**) is a tool developed by psychologists Kenneth **Thomas and Ralph Kilmann** to help individuals understand how different conflict-handling styles affect interpersonal and group dynamics. Here are the main key points about TKI:

1. **Five Conflict Styles**: The TKI identifies five primary conflict styles:
   - **Competing**: Assertive and uncooperative, a power-oriented mode.
   - **Collaborating**: Both assertive and cooperative, seeking a win-win situation.
   - **Compromising**: Moderately assertive and cooperative, finding a middle ground.
   - **Avoiding**: Unassertive and uncooperative, withdrawing from or avoiding conflict.
   - **Accommodating**: Unassertive and cooperative, yielding to the other side.
2. **Situational Application**: The instrument emphasizes that no single style is best in all situations. Effectiveness of a style can depend on the specifics of the conflict situation.
3. **Self-Assessment Tool**: TKI is used as a self-assessment for managing conflict in various environments, including business, educational settings, and personal relationships.
4. **Improving Conflict Resolution Skills**: By understanding their default conflict styles, individuals can learn to adopt the most appropriate strategy for different situations, thus improving their effectiveness in resolving conflicts.
5. **Development and Training Tool**: It is widely used in organizational development and team-building initiatives to enhance communication and interaction among team members.

The TKI serves as a practical framework for navigating conflicts by helping individuals recognize and adjust their behaviors in conflict situations.

## ex2 Conflict-handling approaches 1

| Approach      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accommodating | This is a **lose/win** situation. It involves setting aside your own needs in favour of meeting the other party’s needs.                                                                       |
| Compromising  | This is a **win/lose – lose/win** situation. It involves **working together to find mutually acceptable solutions for both parties’ needs**. A degree of sacrifice may be made from each side. |
| Competing     | This is a **win/lose** situation. It involves **utilizing whatever power you have available** (resources, rank, skills, etc.) to meet your needs and obtain a ‘win’.                           |
| Collaborating | This is a **win/win situation**. It involves **working creatively together with the other party to come up with solutions** that meet the needs of both parties.                               |
| Avoiding      | This is a **lose/lose situation**. It involves deciding not to directly address or resolve the conflict at this particular time. This may be the choice of one or both parties.                |
## ex3 Conflict-handling approaches 2
  
Complete the information with accommodating, avoiding, collaborating, competing or compromising.
1. The competing approach is useful when …
	- making quick decisive actions (e.g. in an emergency)
	- implementing necessary or non-negotiable changes (e.g. redundancies)
	- standing up for your rights or values
2. The collaborating approach is useful when …
	- seeking creative and innovative solutions
	- buy-in is needed from all parties for sustainability (e.g. policy changes)
	- seeking to listen to other people’s viewpoints and build positive relationships
	- expertise and information are present, but authority may be lacking
3. The compromising approach is useful when …
	- you are under time pressure to come up with a solution
	- parties are committed to similar goals
	- you want to demonstrate flexibility and reason
	- accommodating or collaborating strategies aren’t working
	- expertise is present, but authority may be lacking
4. The avoiding approach is useful when …
	- you need a cooling off period to reduce tension 
	- the matter is deemed unimportant
	- conflict could be better managed by other parties
	- authority may be lacking on one or both sides 
5. The accommodating approach is useful when …
	- wanting to show goodwill and maintain positive relationships
	- recognising that the other party’s needs mean more to them than yours do to you
	- avoiding further conflict is more important than your needs
	- you lack authority or decision power and wish to maintain harmony
## ex4 Case study

Read the case study and choose the conflict-handling approach being used in each scenario.

Katia is ambitious, driven and doing her best to grow the business in challenging times among cutbacks and increasing client demands. Katia demands the same dedication from her team as she exhibits, but does not compensate them for the late or weekend hours.

- **competing**:
Mei Ling feels that the conditions are unjust. She decides she will be honest and upfront with Katia about her situation as a mother and point out that, in other companies, work-life balance is encouraged, overtime is optional and always paid.

- **accommodating**:
Mei Ling decides to speak to Katia about her concerns. She will explain that she understands the situation the company is in, but that she would appreciate being given as much notice as possible for calls and deadlines. This would allow Mei Ling to arrange childcare to allow her to participate in calls and manage the workload.
