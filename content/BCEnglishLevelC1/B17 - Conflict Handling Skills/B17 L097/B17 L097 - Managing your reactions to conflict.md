The topic of this lesson is reactions to conflict. You will:
find out how to evaluate the underlying values and expectations that trigger your hot buttons in a conflict
discuss managing physical and emotional reactions to stress when facing conflict situations at work
You will also practise analysing the hot buttons and reactions in past workplace conflict situations and decide what could have been done differently.


## ex1 - Why deal with conflict in the workplace?

#### Choose the correct options.

It is crucial that disagreement and conflict is promptly addressed when it arises in the workplace. Ignoring it can lead to much larger problems for the company and the people involved.

Consequences of **ignoring** conflicts to the company
- Poor quality service (e.g. for customers)
- Financial costs (e.g. sick days)
- High staff turnover
- Damaged reputation and image
- Low productivity

Consequences of **handling** conflicts to the **company**
- Better staff utilisation costs (e.g. less absenteeism)
- Positive reputation and image
- High productivity
- Good quality service
- Staff retention

Consequences of **ignoring** conflicts to the **individual**
- Poor physical and mental well-being
- Feelings of distrust and being undervalued
- Poor decision-making ability leading to mistakes being made
- Low morale and motivation
- Desire to quit

Consequences of **handling** conflicts to the **individual**  
- Job satisfaction and motivation
- Greater loyalty to the company
- Heightened problem-solving skills leading to better decision making
- Gratifying working relationships
- Feelings of inclusion and being valued
- Improved trust and respect

## ex2 - Types of conflict

#### Match the headings to the information.

In the workplace, conflict is inevitable. A combination of disagreement, feeling emotionally upset or uncomfortable and being prevented from reaching your goal leads to a conflict situation.

- **Task conflict**:
	- Arises from differences in ideas and opinions related to work assignments, procedures and policies. E.g. Your colleague has been selected to attend a conference that you had been promised you could go to. When handled well, this type of conflict can encourage greater understanding of workplace issues leading to more creative solutions and better quality decisions.

- **Relationship conflict:** 
	- Arises from differences in communication style, personality and conflict handling approach, leading to tension and clashes between people. E.g. You find your colleague asks leading questions and once you’ve answered these, uses your answers to undermine you. When handled well, this type of conflict can help develop tolerance and acceptance, strengthening motivation and trust.
- **Values conflict:**
	- Arises from fundamental differences in identity and values (norms, ethics, and beliefs). E.g. Work-life balance is important to you and a senior manager keeps  scheduling calls in the evening.


## ex3 - Identify hot buttons
#### Complete the examples of how other people's behaviour can affect us.

Hot buttons are behaviours in other people or situations that trigger emotional, often angry, reactions in us because we feel threatened in some way. This can lead to or escalate a conflict. To manage your hot buttons, identify not only what triggers you but also what values and expectations underlie these.


- When someone focuses too much on minor details or seems over analytical, your value of competence is threatened because your expectation may be to look at the **bigger picture**
- When someone says you are wrong, your value of reputation, status or **self-worth** is impacted.
- When someone keeps to themselves, doesn’t seek your input or seems reserved, you feel **excluded** because you value inclusion.
- When someone insists things are done in a certain way or seems to believe they are always correct, your value of independence or self-sufficiency is threatened and you feel **micromanaged**
- When someone is sarcastic, speaks directly or uses language that is too expressive, your values of harmony and being **emotionally controlled** are affected.
- When someone doesn’t do what was promised or assigned, your expectation of **trustworthiness** is affected.
- When someone doesn't give credit or recognise your work, you don’t feel your contribution is being **recognised**


## ex4 - Staying calm and composed

#### Read the information. Then choose the correct options.

When your hot buttons are triggered, emotions like anger, fear or frustration cause stress chemicals to flood through the body reducing attention and the ability to see multiple perspectives. If we don’t calm ourselves down, we may end up saying and doing things we regret. Practising calming techniques can help us to remain calm and focused.

1. **Notice:** Pay attention to your physical reactions (e.g. increased heart rate and perspiration, shallow or accelerated breathing, nausea, a flushed face or a tightening in the back of the neck or jaw or a desire to flee). Recognising these reactions makes them **easier to manage**.  
2. **Pause:** Be still for a moment. It gives you time and a chance to choose your response. Try to make your body language **more open and relaxed** in order to diffuse the tension.  
3. **Focus:** Focus on a ‘concentration point’ such as a pencil on the table or a light. Doing this will help you to **change your focus from** the situation that triggered your emotions.  
4. **Observe:** Try to identify your emotions. Researchers have found that **verbalising**  emotions makes them feel less intense. Also, identify the assumptions and conclusions you’ve made about the situation and the other party’s behaviour. Recognising these will help you assess them objectively.  
5. **Breathe:** Take a deep breath, hold, and release it **slowly**. For example, try breathing in for four counts, holding that breath for seven counts and then exhaling for eight counts. Do this a few times to quickly relieve stress.
