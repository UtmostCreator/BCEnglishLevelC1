## ex1 - Non-verbal techniques for defusing emotion 1

In a conflict situation, ensure the other person doesn’t interpret your body language as aggressive, which can escalate the situation. Check your own body language and tone of voice to ensure you are not contributing to the stress in the situation.

Here is a comparison table outlining the differences between facial and behavioral expressions that can seem threatening or aggressive, and their more relaxed or non-threatening alternatives:

| Aggressive Expression              | Relaxed/Non-threatening Alternative    |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Tightened or pursed lips           | Gently closed mouth                    |
| Narrowed eyes                      | Relaxed eyes                           |
| Tightened jaw and neck, clenched teeth | Loosely held jaw                     |
| Frowning, scowling, lowered eyebrows | Smooth forehead                      |
| Steady eye contact / glaring       | Reduce constant eye contact; make contact for about 60% of the time |
| Short, shallow, or quick breathing | Slow, deep breathing                   |
| Fast pace of speech                | Talking in a calm, steady way          |
| Loud volume, high or low pitch     | Moderate volume and pitch              |

Certainly! Here are more detailed descriptions of the feelings and possible thoughts of both parties involved in each action:

   - **Staring person:** Likely feels curious, judgmental, or confrontational. They might be thinking, "What are you doing?" or "I'm trying to understand you."

## ex3 - Verbal techniques for defusing emotion

Assume that the other party has a right to be angry. It may not be your fault. However, it’s important to keep in mind the needs of the angry speaker. Communicate with respect, clarity and empathy and use positive language that avoids blaming.

Listen **without interrupting** to let the person vent.
Acknowledge your partner's perspective and clarify your understanding of their key points by **paraphrasing** them.
You may **disarm** the conflict by finding areas of common agreement, no matter how small.
**Empathise with** your partner's feelings even if you don't agree with what they said.
Focus on **facts**when you explain your perspective.
Fix what can be fixed **immediately**, creating a small change to achieve success.
Get your partner  to say **yes** to something. It’s **difficult** for a person to stay angry if they agree with you.
Check if your reactions are contributing to the situation. To avoid taking things personally and reacting defensively, remind yourself they are angry with the situation and probably afraid of **not reaching** their goals or expectations.

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trust is built when our behaviour is similar to that of the other person.         | To calm down an agitated person, it is best to first be extremely calm and quiet and slowly get louder until you match the other speaker. |
| Try to mirror someone else's energy rather than their aggressive body language.   | Tell yourself that the other person has no right to be angry.                                                                             |
| Focus on the person you are in conflict with first, and then the problem at hand. | Share your own thoughts and feelings before acknowledging the other person's.                                                             |
| It is important to give the other person an opportunity to voice their thoughts.  |                                                                                                                                           |
| Use positive language that avoids blaming anyone.                                 |                                                                                                                                           |

1. **Trust is built when our behaviour is similar to that of the other person.**
   - True: Building trust often involves establishing rapport and connection, which can be facilitated by mirroring the behavior, tone, or body language of the other person. This can help create a sense of familiarity and understanding.
2. **To calm down an agitated person, it is best to first be extremely calm and quiet and slowly get louder until you match the other speaker.**
   - False: Matching an agitated person's energy level can escalate the situation further. It's generally more effective to remain calm and composed, which can help de-escalate the other person's emotions.
3. **Try to mirror someone else's energy rather than their aggressive body language.**
   - True: Mirroring someone's energy level, such as speaking at a similar pace or using similar gestures, can foster rapport and facilitate communication. However, mirroring aggressive body language may not be productive and could exacerbate the conflict.
4. **Focus on the person you are in conflict with first, and then the problem at hand.**
   - True: Addressing the underlying emotions and concerns of the individuals involved can be crucial in resolving conflicts. By focusing on the person first, you demonstrate empathy and create a conducive environment for problem-solving.
5. **Tell yourself that the other person has no right to be angry.**
   - False: Dismissing or invalidating someone's emotions, such as anger, can escalate tensions and hinder resolution. Recognizing and acknowledging the other person's feelings is essential for effective communication and conflict resolution.
6. **It is important to give the other person an opportunity to voice their thoughts.**
   - True: Active listening and allowing the other person to express their thoughts and feelings fosters mutual understanding and respect. Providing an opportunity for open communication can lead to constructive dialogue and resolution.
7. **Use positive language that avoids blaming anyone.**
   - True: Positive language encourages constructive communication and focuses on finding solutions rather than assigning blame. By using language that is non-confrontational and respectful, you create a supportive environment for resolving conflicts.
8. **Share your own thoughts and feelings before acknowledging the other person's.**
   - False: Prioritizing the other person's perspective and emotions demonstrates empathy and can foster trust and cooperation. Starting with active listening and acknowledgment of the other person's viewpoint sets a positive tone for the conversation.
