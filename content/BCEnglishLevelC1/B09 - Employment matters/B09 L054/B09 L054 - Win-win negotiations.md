In this lesson you will take part in a negotiation between an international supplier and purchaser to achieve the most mutually beneficial deal.  You will listen to a similar negotiation and read about the elements of successful negotiating. You will practise the language appropriate to each stage of a negotiation.


We are willing to supply 100 bicycles by the **30th** of May and 100 **up** to **10 days** later at a discount of **20 %**, with a further reduction of **10 %** on any repeat order over **250** . The bicycles are under warranty, so there is no need for free customer support in case of any issues with the product.


  
Bidding and bargaining are two distinct phases in negotiation. **Bidding** is the initial offer stage where each party presents what they are willing to give or receive. It sets the groundwork for the negotiation, outlining the starting points for both sides. **Bargaining**, on the other hand, involves back-and-forth discussions on these initial offers. It's the process of making adjustments to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Bidding sets the stage, while bargaining is where the negotiation truly takes shape through compromise and adjustment.

**Bargaining** - two parties begin to trade adjustments to the initial offer (It might also include additional features of the deal not mentioned before)
**Settling** - When the deal is agreed, it is usually formalised in some way – by recapping what has been negotiated and / or following up with some form of action, e.g. a contract, an email, or a simple handshake.

## idioms

**turn out to be** - used to say that something or someone eventually becomes something or is found to have a particular identity, quality, ability, etc.
	means to eventually become something or be revealed to have a certain characteristic. It's often used when the final nature, quality, or identity of someone or something is different from what was initially thought or expected. For example, if someone says, "The weather turned out to be nice," it implies that the weather ended up being nice contrary to what might have been expected.
