## ex3 - An article about computer intelligence

 Beyond this point, labelled the **_event horizon_**, future events cannot be predicted with our current means.
 The '**Singularity**' is a stage in the future when ... artificial intelligence becomes the same as or goes beyond human intelligence.
1. The **'Singularity'** is a stage in the future when artificial intelligence becomes the same as or goes beyond human intelligence
2. The **'Event horizon'** is the point when a civilisation changes so much that it becomes incomprehensible to earlier generations
3. Examples of passing the Turing test would be the ability to flirt, make jokes, or understand when someone is being sarcastic
4. Kurzweil is sure about when the **Singularity** will happen because of a law which states that computer power accelerates over time
