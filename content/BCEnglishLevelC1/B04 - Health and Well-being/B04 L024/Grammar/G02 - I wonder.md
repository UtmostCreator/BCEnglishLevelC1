## I was wondering - to make indirect request

> we usually follow the phrase with a question to ask permission.
> **“I was wondering” works whenever you want to indirectly ask for permission or help. It is a polite way to introduce a question or ask for something that might otherwise be portrayed as rude.**


“Was” is a past tense word. We use it in this phrase to show that we were previously thinking to ourselves, but now we are acting on whatever that thought might have been. For example:

- I was wondering if you could help me.

You can see how impactful “I was wondering” is on the following examples:

- Can you help me?
- I was wondering if you could help me.
The two requests are identical, but using “I was wondering” helps the listener to understand that we’re not pressuring them, and we’re trying to be as polite as possible.

You might also find the word “**just**” comes into play. This mostly applies to informal situations and can typically show up in spoken English. Here’s how it would look:

- I was just wondering if you have a moment to spare.

The “just” makes the request after it seems more like an afterthought. This helps **to show the listener that we’re not desperate for their permission**, and we will be okay if they turn us down. However, their acceptance would be [greatly appreciated](https://grammarhow.com/greatly-appreciated/) in these situations.
## I am wondering - to share you present thoughts

> **You can use “I am wondering” when you want to write something that is in the present progressive form. This means we are thinking about something presently, but we’re not sure what our future actions are going to be (until we’ve decided).**

“I am wondering” and “I wonder” are both related to the present tense. They are **almost identical** in meaning, but we typically use “I am wondering” as the present progressive tense, which we mostly use **when we want to determine what happens next:**

- I am wondering what I should do.

There aren’t too many cases where this phrase works all that well. It’s definitely the most specific of the forms. Still, we might see it [as follows](https://grammarhow.com/as-following-vs-as-follows-vs-as-follow/):

- I am wondering if I should go after her.

As you can see, we haven’t decided upon our next action. We are trying to decide whether it’s worth doing or not, which is what “I am wondering” is trying to do for us.

The idea is that by the time we finish “wondering,” we should know what to do.

Again, “just” comes into play to make the phrase even more informal than before:

- I am just wondering if I should stick around for this.

It’s similar to “I was just wondering,” but this time, “just” shows an urgency to the “wondering” action. Typically, we don’t have long to make our final decision, and we’re showing that we’re trying to think as quickly as we can.
## I wonder - to express thoughts in a similar way

> “I wonder” is a general way to **express** a **thought**. We typically use it when we want to know more about **certain situations or things that have happened around us.**

“I wonder” is a [much more](https://grammarhow.com/much-more-meaning/) general way to establish or express our thoughts to others.

- I wonder what happened over there.

You can see how the phrase differs from “I am wondering” by referring to the following example:

- I wonder if anybody noticed me leaving.

As you can see, “I wonder” is a simple way to express our current thought. We might currently be thinking about our previous exit from something and wondering if “anybody noticed” or if we weren’t caught.
