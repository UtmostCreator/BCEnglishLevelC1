_**Rule: Backward reference**_

> The **cake** was delicious. **It** was the best I ever had.
> **Cake** - subject
> **It** - *is a backward reference*

After the **software** update, **it** started to malfunction
The **trip** to Toronto was unforgettable. **It** had everything you could ask for in a vacation

(clause 1) “Three tech giants filed for bankruptcy.” (clause 2) “It was shocking.”

(clause 1) subject (specified) + verb + obj. complement.
(clause 2) subject (unspecified; it) + verb + obj. complement.

The **subject** in the **second** clause is **unspecified**. However, it’s implicitly **understood** to be **referencing** the subject **in the first clause**.
> In other words, 
> - **tell the reader what the subject is first**, then
> - **reference back** to it **and add information in the second clause**.
## cataphoric - Some info about SBJ - SUBJECT

_**Rule: Forward reference (converse of anaphora)**_

> The **cake** was delicious. **It** was the best I ever had.
> **Cake** - subject
> **It** - *is a backward reference*

**It** started to malfunction after the software update
**It** was an adventure of a lifetime, that trip to Toronto

(clause 1) “Yesterday’s news was shocking.” (clause 2) “Three tech giants filed for bankruptcy.”

(clause 1) subject (unspecified; it) + verb + obj. complement.
(clause 2) subject (specified) + verb + obj. complement.

The subject in the first clause is unspecified, which begs the question: “what is it?” or “what is the subject?” **The subject in the second clause provides clarifying information** to the subject of the first clause.

> In other words, 
> - **tell** the reader **some information** about **the subject**, then
> - reference forwards to the second clause and **tell** us **what the subject is**.
