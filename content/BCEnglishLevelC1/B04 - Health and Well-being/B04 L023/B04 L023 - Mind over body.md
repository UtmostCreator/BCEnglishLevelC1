In this class you will take part in a TV panel show discussing research into the mind/body connection. You will read about research in the field and decide how best to explain the information. You will describe the research and discuss the contributions of others. You will focus on the language you need to explain evidence and conclusions clearly and ask for and give clarification.

1. Heart disease: Refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart's structure and function, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias
2. Cancer: A group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, which can invade and destroy healthy tissues and organs
3. Ulcers: Open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach, small intestine, or esophagus, often caused by infection with H. pylori bacteria or long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
4. Allergies: The body's immune system overreacts to normally harmless substances (allergens) such as pollen, dust mites, or certain foods, leading to symptoms like sneezing, itching, and hives
5. Arthritis: Inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain, stiffness, and swelling. There are many types of arthritis, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
6. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): A common digestive disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits, without any detectable structural abnormalities
7. Eczema: A chronic skin condition characterized by inflammation, itching, and redness, often with patches of dry, scaly skin that may ooze or crust over

`a range of factors`
There's a whole range of factors that influence the activity of our genes, - stress, diet, emotion, hereditary factors – epigenetics is the study of this.

`the very opposite is true`
So asthma is all in the mind? No, the opposite is true. Our minds contribute in a very real way to the processes in our body – nothing imaginary about it.

`we can flip the coin`
If we can identify the negative then we can flip the coin through training and good mind practice to have positive effects on the body. We can teach the mind.

`it's a huge growth area`
you can train people to use their minds to keep themselves healthy – huge growth area – lots of mind-training sites e.g. Luminosity - mushrooming

`neither positive nor negative`
neuroplasticity (the brain's ability to develop and change) is neither positive or negative – it's what we do with it that matters

`we now have the tools`
increasing openness in the scientific community – partly because we now have efficient tools to study the mind's influence – the more the evidence, the more ideas are accepted.

`the data is there`
well-respected scientists have published compelling, evidence-based data/incontrovertible evidence that the mind has a strong influence over our bodies in terms of sickness and health ...
