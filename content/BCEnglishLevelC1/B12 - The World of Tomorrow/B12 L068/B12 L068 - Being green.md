The topic of this lesson is working with your group to produce a list of the most desirable things that individuals and the government can do to help the environment. You will:

- listen to people talk about what they do to 'be green'
- focus on the relevant language that they use.

1. I’m a very **conscious** shopper. I try and buy organic **whenever** possible.

3. I’m **all** for helping the environment but some people go a bit over the **top**.
4. And I don’t **beat** myself **up** about recycling – I suspect it’s a complete **waste** of time and it all ends up in a landfill site somewhere anyway.
5. But I do have a **thing** about cars and pollution and traffic congestion.
6. I don’t always practise what I **preach** though …

8. Most people don’t have a **clue** about what’s in the food they’re buying.
9. I feel a bit **overwhelmed** by it all to be honest – global warming, extinctions, water shortages …
10. For me, I think limiting consumption is **key**. I’ve made a real **effort** to stop buying so much stuff – no new shoes this year – I’ve got enough.
11. I do believe that small actions make a **difference** – act local, think global – and small changes are **worth** making.
