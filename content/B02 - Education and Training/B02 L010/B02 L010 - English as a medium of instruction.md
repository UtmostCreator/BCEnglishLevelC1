As far as I’m concerned, introducing children to gadgets early, with time limitations, can make a huge difference. regulated use for educational materials and movies can enhance learning. I’m in favor of this approach because it aligns with preparing kids for a digital future (it can help them to get used to it quite quickly, and it also simplies the future living, as i believe it will simplify and speed up the process of using tech gadges in every aspect of their life - no only learning). My view is that, with proper guidance, technology becomes a tool for advancement rather than distraction.
For instance let's assume we can introduce a software which teaches how to use grammar, how to fix their mistakes, and where to search the information.



Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineer position. Although I do not have direct experience with CI/CD, my proficiency with git and a solid understanding of Linux command lines set a strong foundation for managing servers and projects efficiently. My ability to utilize tmux for multitasking across multiple projects without the need to switch windows showcases my skill in optimizing workflow using the keyboard for various command-line interfaces.
Experince using SSH, and MySQL from CLI can be benefical for some special cases, especially when GUI is not available.

Overall my knowledge is extensible and diverse as I have been using PHP since 2015. My experience extends to PHP frameworks, notably with two years of developing projects using yii2. I have also engineered a custom framework for a freelance client, designed for lightweight solutions with specific requirements. This initiative underscores my ability to develop custom solutions while ensuring scalability, extensibility, flexibility, and decoupling wherever possible. Inspired by Laravel, my framework incorporates elements from Symfony, particularly for functionalities such as migrations, CRUD operations, and executing CLI commands for promotional emails. This approach highlights my commitment to creating scalable and flexible projects, emphasizing the importance of an extensible and decoupled architecture.

Despite my shorter experience with Laravel(half a year), my extensive engagement with PHP assures my capability in tackling complex challenges collaboratively. My work in API development emphasizes ease of use and security, underscoring the importance of writing clear, logical code that adheres to OOP principles and best practices.

Transitioning to JavaScript frameworks, I demonstrated adaptability by swiftly learning Aurelia 1 and leading the migration of a project to Vue.js 2, and subsequently to Vue 3, showcasing my ability to quickly grasp new technologies. My role in these migrations underscores my leadership and adaptability, qualities that are vital for a dynamic software development environment.

In addition to frontend development, my background in API testing with Postman and website testing with Cypress reflects my comprehensive approach to software quality. My experience in Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, complements my technical skills with a strong emphasis on team collaboration and efficient project management.

Although I am yet to gain experience in cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, my track record of migrating projects and optimizing databases demonstrates my readiness to learn and adapt to new technologies. My proficiency with tools like PhpStorm and GitHub Copilot, coupled with an interest in leveraging GPT-4 for project enhancement, showcases my commitment to leveraging technology to drive efficiency and innovation.

I am eager to bring my blend of skills, adaptability, and a proactive approach to your team. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the needs of your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your projects and am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Warm regards,


How would you create a cover letter to highlight relevant experience?

Overall my knowledge is extensible and diverse as I have been using PHP since 2015. I have quite diverse experience in PHP frameworks. Having 2 years of experience with Yii2 which i have used to create a few rich products for a shop and for a social media platform, utilizing its packages, and additonal plugins. A few years later, I developed my own framework for one of my freelance clients, where there was a need for a lightweight solution with specific requirements, which I was able to tailor to my client without changing the codebase of existing frameworks. Considering my years of proactive and engaging experience with PHP, there is no task too challenging for a team that we cannot resolve together. My primary inspiration has been the Laravel framework, although I have used some Symfony classes, e.g., for migrations, CRUD operations, and CLI commands when sending promotional emails, which are generated and sent based on selected options from the CLI. It allowed administrators to visually track running processes and their hierarchical structure (using IDs and timestamps), ensuring the ability to review the history of events and identify any issues. Although my experience with Laravel spans only about half a year, Laravel's codebase, documentation, and the design patterns they use for many of their internal processes are remarkably accessible and well-documented.

When talking about API development, ease of use and security from unauthorized access are the first priority. Writing human-readable code that follows logic, possibly without needing comments or documentation, though providing them can offer more clues about its use, is essential. Respecting OOP principles and adhering to best practices is key, as principles are transferable, unlike practices, which I always aim to keep the codebase maintainable as time allows, as we always have a deadline. I have worked on a single project and used 3 JS frameworks, one after the other. Joining a project with Aurelia 1, I quickly grapsed the basics of it and had no issues when I was using, even though it was completely new framework to me. However, a decision was made to transition to more popular and extensible frameworks like Vue.js 2, where I led the migration of the entire project to a completely new framework. Later, with the emergence of Vue 3 and a new developer joining the team for backend work, the desire to transition to Vue 3 appeared, and this transition, along with the move from Vuex to Pinia, was completed, simplifying state management. I have a diverse and useful experience with nested levels of components, utilizing either storage or provide/inject to pass context and data to child components. For personal projects, I have used TypeScript and Angular 4 to create simple applications, gaining an understanding of how it differs from other frameworks. Knowing more than one framework, whether JS or PHP, allows me to start with any new framework needed for a project.

I have been working and testing APIs via Postman for integration and security purposes, ensuring documentation is in place for easy handoff to other developers. My experience mainly relates to testing different methods (POST, GET, DELETE, PUT, PATCH) with various parameters and actions to chain requests or unpack responses. With Cypress, I tackled testing a website across different domains, a challenge due to Cypress's limitations with cross-domain testing. This was particularly necessary for auth0 testing and verifying specific outcomes after a sequence of actions.
As my responsibilities clearly indicate the need to provide input and guidance for "cross-functional" teams, and ensuring our cycle is always up to date, tested, and less prone to bugs. Talking about Agile, or in my case, Scrum, my experience has been positive, with proper management, estimation, and communication yielding good results. Daily standups keep the team updated, allow for clarifications to move forward, and ideally involve reviewing and deploying new changes before the end of Thursday, so they can be tested and committed to a test branch, and by Friday, delivered to products as required, streamlining productivity.

I lack cloud experience like AWS or Azure. However, I have migrated projects from PHP 5 to 7 and from Aurelia and Vue 2 to Vue 3. I am familiar with logs for daily debugging or project migrations, along with Apache or Nginx configurations to control error displays, aiding in migrations. I use PhpStorm for coding, allowing me to exclude folders from searches and navigate project structures or perform global text/file searches. I have experience using GitHub Copilot for projects, speeding up writing methods, comments, and understanding even more. GPT-4 is another technology everyone is aware of, but not everyone knows how to use it properly and when.

I am eager to learn more and would be glad to share my experience with the team. I am energetic, adaptable, always active, and happy to share my opinions on improvements. Productive and always striving to deliver the best possible results, I have practical skills and knowledge. Focusing on tasks at hand and working towards their completion and the functionality they are intended to deliver.
