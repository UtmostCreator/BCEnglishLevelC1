The topic of this lesson is proposing solutions in conflict situations. You will:
find out about generating ideas to be used to conflict situations
find out how to evaluate generated ideas
discuss selecting techniques to use in conflict situations
You will also practise identifying a relevant and realistic solution to a conflict situation.

## ex1 - A problem-solving process

Use a problem-solving process to seek viable outcomes for your conflict situations. You may not always follow the steps in a purely linear fashion. For example, if you are having difficulty selecting an option, it may be necessary to revisit needs and wants again and brainstorm new options.

| Step                                                                                                                                             | Action                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 1: Establish the conflict situation by                                                                                                      | ensuring both parties are clear on what the issue is that needs addressing.                         |
| Step 2: List your and the other party's needs and wants                                                                                          | collaboratively where possible.                                                                     |
| Step 3: Brainstorm possible solutions individually or collaboratively depending on your approach (there are no good or bad ideas at this stage). | or collaboratively depending on your approach (there are no good or bad ideas at this stage).       |
| Step 4: Evaluate the options by                                                                                                                  | using relevant criteria to narrow down your options in relation to your approach and the situation. |
| Step 5: Select the best possible solution under the circumstances by                                                                             | asking closed questions to build agreement for the proposed solution.                               |
## ex2 - Question prompts to guide your problem-solving process 1(3-5) and 2 (4-5)

Here are some questions to guide your thinking when going through the problem-solving process. Involve the other party where possible, as conflict resolution is usually more effective when framed as ‘us’ versus ‘the issue’ rather than ‘me’ versus ‘you’.

| Step 1: Establish the conflict situation: | Step 2: List your and the other party's needs and wants:    | Step 3: Brainstorm possible solutions: | Step4: Evaluate the options:                     | Step 5: Select the best possible solution under the circumstances: |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What is the type of conflict?             | What do you need and want from this situation?              | What if we ... ?                       | To what extent do the solutions meet your needs? | Are we happy with what we've discussed?                            |
| What emotions are involved?               | Why do you need resolution?                                 | Could we try ...?                      | How feasible are they to implement?              | Is this something I/we can commit to?                              |
| Who is involved in the conflict?          | Which needs or wants would you be willing to compromise on? | How about...?                          | What behaviors are being seen?                   | Would this solution realistically work?                            |

## ex4 - Generating creative solutions

**Forced association**

Use this technique to compare your conflict situation to an unrelated concept and see what ideas emerge.
Select an object or concept to represent your conflict situation or relationship you want to improve.
Ask, 'How is this situation like ...?'
From your answers, generate ideas that can improve your situation.
For example:
**Situation**: Disagreement with a colleague
**Concept**: Football pitch
Two sides: We don’t always recognise there are two ‘sides’ or perspectives to a situation
Goal posts: We ultimately both want the same outcome
Net: We have supported each other in the past
Grass: Our relationship needs ‘watering’ to keep it growing
From these insights, generate ideas to improve each aspect of the situation.

**Forming agreements**

Use this technique to generate ideas for mutually improving a current conflict situation.
Each party works individually on a piece of paper.

Use the IDEA acronym to generate solutions that could move the situation forward to a positive outcome.
Ask: 'What behaviour, actions, policies, processes, systems, habits, thoughts or emotions could be...?'
WHERE IDEA is:
- introduced
- dropped
- extended
- adjusted
Once finished, come together to review commonalities which can be used to form mutually agreed solutions.
