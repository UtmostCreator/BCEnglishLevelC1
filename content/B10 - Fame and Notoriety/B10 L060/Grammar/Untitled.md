### Sentence 1:

- Original: "I’d been in touch with her on and off for several years, while I was researching the background for the book, but we’d never met."
- Question: Could we use "I was in touch with her" in this sentence?
- **Explanation**: Yes, using "I was in touch with her" instead of "I’d been in touch with her" is grammatically correct but changes the nuance slightly. "I was in touch with her" suggests a more general and less specific timeframe of communication, whereas "I’d been in touch with her" (past perfect continuous) emphasizes the ongoing, intermittent nature of the contact over several years prior to another past event (the time of writing or discussing the book).

### Sentence 2:

- Original: "I don’t think I would have liked the young woman much, but I’ve always been strangely drawn to her mixture of strength and vulnerability."
- Question: How does the meaning change if we use "I don’t think I liked the young woman much"?
- **Explanation**: Changing to "I don’t think I liked the young woman much" suggests a past direct experience or interaction with the young woman, implying the speaker had personally known her. The original "would have liked" indicates a hypothetical or inferred feeling based on her reputation or descriptions from others, without actual interaction.

### Sentence 3:

- Original: "She chose a rather old-fashioned, quiet little hotel in central London."
- Question: Is "she had chosen" possible here?
- **Explanation**: Yes, "she had chosen" is possible and correct. It would shift the emphasis slightly, stressing that the choice was made prior to some other past context or narrative focus. It emphasizes the completion of her decision before the following actions or descriptions.

### Sentence 4:

- Original: "Well of course, she was well into her eighties then, but you could see the striking beauty that had attracted so many lovers."
- Question: Could we use "has attracted" here?
- **Explanation**: No, "has attracted" would not be appropriate if referring to someone who is no longer alive or if the context is historical. "Had attracted" is correct because it describes events or states in the past that have completed, especially relevant when discussing someone’s past attributes in a past context.

### Sentence 5:

- Original: "Women have always tended to write about relationships – people interacting, doing real things, but that has never made women’s fiction shallow."
- Question: Would this sentence work in the present simple? Would the meaning change?
- **Explanation**: Yes, using the present simple ("Women always write about relationships") could work, emphasizing a general, timeless statement about women's writing habits. However, the original phrasing with "have tended to" suggests a slightly softer, more observational tone about past and ongoing tendencies, adding a sense of continuity through time.

### Sentence 6:

- Original: "For me she’s a feminist icon. It wasn’t a role she sought when she was alive and she wouldn’t have been flattered by the title."
- Question: Can we use "it wasn’t a role she had sought"?
- **Explanation**: Yes, using "it wasn’t a role she had sought" is perfectly acceptable and retains the same meaning. It emphasizes that her not seeking the role of a feminist icon occurred before another past action or state (her reaction to being considered as such).

Each of these explanations helps clarify how subtle changes in verb tense or wording can subtly or significantly alter the meaning conveyed in a narrative context.
