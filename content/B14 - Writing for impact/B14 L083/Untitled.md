**Background**

Over the past two decades West Waterford has experienced a **gradual decline** and is widely considered **to be one of the most rundown** and economically poor areas of the city.

**Issues**

**1.** De-industrialisation  
The area has **undergone** a rapid and painful period of de-industrialisation from its **heyday** as the country’s **steelworks** capital. Its **steelworks** plant now lies **derelict** and is rapidly falling into disrepair and risks becoming **something of a public health hazard**. The closure of the plant has also led to high levels of chronic unemployment amongst its former employees, who face a future of limited opportunities.

**2.** Poor transportation  
WW suffers from a severe lack of public transport options. As one of the few areas in the city without metro links, it relies heavily on bus services. However, these are insufficiently frequent and often overcrowded. This has hampered the area’s ability to attract investment into the area and local residents’ ability to reach other areas of the city. This has also led to a sense of isolation amongst local residents.

**3.** Lack of social / leisure activities

There is a distinct lack of options for social / leisure activities. A leisure centre existed until two year ago, but needed updating and was closed due to insufficient funding. This, along with poverty, has resulted in an unhealthy and overweight local population. The area is also extremely limited in terms of bars, cafés and restaurants, adding to the sense of social depression.

**Recommendations**

**1.** Embark on an ambitious regeneration programme by demolishing the steelworks factory and using the land to create an outlet shopping village. This would feature a park at its centre and a demarcated bar / restaurant zone and a sports complex with swimming pool, sports fields and gym.  
Former employees of the steelworks would be given first preference to work on the construction of this new retail area and employment opportunities at the village would offer a more long-term solution.

**2.** For the above recommendation to be a success, transport will have to be improved. Beyond an increase in the frequency and coverage of the bus service, we recommend the construction of an overland train shuttle from the city centre to transport shoppers to the new outlet village. Apart from the boost to the local economy that shoppers will provide, it will also allow local residents to reach other parts of the city more easily, thereby lessening the sense of isolation.

**Conclusion**

The West Waterford Residents’ Association believes that the area is in dire need of regeneration and urges the city council to take our proposal into serious consideration.  
We feel sure that if these suggestions are implemented, the local area will not just recover, but will set the standard in urban regeneration.
