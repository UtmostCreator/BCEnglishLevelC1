From complex to simple and clear
The topic of this lesson is making complex ideas simple. You will:
look at analysing the reader to identify the message
find out about a process for communicating core messages
identify and practise writing approaches to make your messages understandable and memorable.
You will also evaluate and simplify the executive summary of a business proposal or other piece of writing.

## ex1 - Performing reader analysis

| Reader profile                                                                               | Complex idea                                                     | Reader needs                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| What shared knowledge, information, or experience do they already have related to this idea? | What is it?                                                      | What do you know about them?            |
| What contextual information will they need to have to be able to understand?                 | Do you have all the relevant information you need to explain it? | What is one thing they must understand? |

## ex2 - Identifying appropriate content

Use the **gathered** information to determine content: 

1. Select only **relevant** information and omit **unnecessary** details.
2. Prioritize the **core** messages and select ‘one-thing’ if possible.
3. Adjust the amount of **contextual** information.
4. Include examples and **comparisons** that the reader can relate to.
5. Edit the amount or inclusion of **jargon**.

## ex3 - FOCUS writing

#### FOCUS stands for Formatting-Organisation-Concise-Use Imagery-Simplicity.

**Simplicity** and **concise** both aim to enhance clarity but differ in focus:

| Category   | Definition                                                                                          | Focus                                   | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Simplicity | Making something easy to understand by using plain language and straightforward concepts.           | Clarity and ease of understanding.      | Complex: *"The juxtaposition of the contrasting elements created a visually striking effect."* Simple: *"The mix of different colors looked amazing."*                                                             |
| Concise    | Conveying information in as few words as necessary, eliminating redundancy and unnecessary details. | Brevity and to-the-point communication. | Wordy: *"Due to the fact that the project deadline is approaching, it is imperative that we expedite the completion of our tasks."* Concise: *"We need to finish our tasks quickly because the deadline is near."* |

### Summary of Differences:
- **Simplicity** emphasizes making the message **easy** to *understand* by **avoiding complex words** and concepts.
- **Concise** emphasizes brevity, focusing on delivering the message in the **fewest words possible without losing meaning**.


| Organisation                                                                             | Formatting                                                               | Concise                                                           | Simplicity                                              | Use Imagery                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provide **subheadings** to divide up the different components of the concept.            | Use **bullet points** to present information.                            | Edit **redundant** words that don’t add meaning.                  | *Define* any necessary **complex/unfamiliar** *terms*.  | Insert simple **visuals** or **graphics** to supplement the written message.     |
| Communicate different components to your reader in sections rather **than all at once**. | **Create space on the page** by using short paragraphs and line spacing. | Use the **active voice** for **clearer**, **shorter** *messages*. | Use **simple word** choice or structure where possible. | Paint a **picture** with your words using **metaphors** and descriptive language |

Certainly! Here are examples illustrating each aspect of the FOCUS acronym:

### 1. **Formatting**
**Example:**
Before: *"We need to complete the project by next Friday and ensure all reports are submitted."*
After: 
- **Project Deadline:** Next Friday
- **Task:** Ensure all reports are submitted

**Explanation:** Using bullet points makes the information clearer and easier to follow.

### 2. **Organisation**
**Example:**
Before: *"Our goal is to increase sales, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline operations."*
After: 
1. **Increase Sales**
2. **Improve Customer Satisfaction**
3. **Streamline Operations**

**Explanation:** Listing goals in order clarifies priorities and structure.

### 3. **Concise**
**Example:**
Before: *"In order to achieve a better understanding of the market trends, we should conduct an in-depth analysis and review previous data."*
After: *"Conduct an analysis to understand market trends."*

**Explanation:** The revised sentence is more direct and to the point.

### 4. **Use Imagery**
**Example:**
Before: *"Our new software is user-friendly and intuitive."*
After: *"Our new software is as easy to use as sending a text message."*

**Explanation:** The comparison provides a vivid image of simplicity.

### 5. **Simplicity**
**Example:**
Before: *"Utilize this application to expedite the processing of your tasks."*
After: *"Use this app to speed up your tasks."*

**Explanation:** Simplified language makes the message clearer and more accessible.
