## ex2 - Writer types

Sure, here are the main points highlighted in bold:

- **Assertive writers** balance their needs and **perspective** with their reader’s. They show **consideration** for their reader and frame their message **positively**, so their argument is more likely to be received. 
- **Aggressive writers** look to win 100% of the argument. They write about their own interests with no concern for the needs, wants, perspectives, or feelings of their reader. They look to **criticize**, **diminish**, and **blame** their reader.
- **Passive writers** do not state their opinions openly and are **insecure** about their knowledge. They find it difficult to **influence** others to take action and finish by **submitting** to other people’s demands or ideas.
