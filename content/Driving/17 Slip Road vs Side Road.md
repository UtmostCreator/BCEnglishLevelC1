"Side road" and "slip road" are two different types of roads with distinct purposes:

- Side Road: A side road is a general term used to describe any road that intersects or connects with a larger, primary road or highway. These roads are typically perpendicular to the main road and provide access to local streets, driveways, or properties. Side roads are used for entering or exiting the main road and for local traffic within neighborhoods and communities.

- Slip Road (also known as an On-ramp or Off-ramp): A slip road, on the other hand, is a specific type of road designed for vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway or motorway. Slip roads are usually longer and more gradual in their curves to allow vehicles to merge safely with the higher-speed traffic on the main road. An "on-ramp" is used for entering the highway, and an "off-ramp" is used for exiting from the highway.

In summary, while a side road is a general term for any road that connects to a primary road, a slip road is a type of road specifically designed for entering or exiting controlled-access highways or motorways.
