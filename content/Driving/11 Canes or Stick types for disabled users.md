Guide Cane
A guide cane is a shorter cane that is used to catch any immediate obstacles. This cane is held diagonally across your body and used to find obstacles in your path including curbs and steps.  

Symbol Cane
A white cane that is less commonly known is the symbol cane. These are good for people with low but useful vision. The user would hold the symbol cane in front of themselves to let people around them known that they are partially sighted. While this cane is smaller than the standard long cane, it can be useful in busy locations.
