### What is VIN/Registration Etching?
VIN Vehicle Identification Number
VIN/Registration Etching is the permanent marking of your car's VIN/Registration number onto your vehicle windows. Once marked the Etched glass is permanently identifiable to your vehicle forming a very strong deterrent to car thieves. 

Consider having your registration number etched on all your car windows. This is a cheap and effective deterrent to professional thieves. 

Having your registration number etched on all your car windows is a security measure aimed at deterring theft and aiding in the recovery of your vehicle if it is stolen. It involves permanently marking your vehicle's registration number onto the glass surfaces of the windows. Here's why it can be beneficial: 
- Deterrence: This visible marking can deter potential thieves, especially professional ones, as it makes the vehicle more easily traceable and less attractive as a target. 
- Identification: If your car is stolen and recovered, the etched registration number can help law enforcement identify the vehicle as yours and return it to you more quickly. 
- Resale Deterrent: Thieves may avoid stealing vehicles with etched windows because it can make it harder for them to sell stolen cars to unsuspecting buyers. 
- Insurance Benefits: Some insurance companies may offer reduced premiums or other benefits for vehicles with added security measures like window etching. 

It's important to note that while this measure can be effective, it's just one part of a broader approach to vehicle security. It should be used in conjunction with other security practices such as:
- using steering wheel locks;
- parking in well-lit areas;
- and installing car alarms to maximize the protection of your vehicle against theft.
