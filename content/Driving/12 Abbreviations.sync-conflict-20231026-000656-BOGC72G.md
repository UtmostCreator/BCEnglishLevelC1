## Electronic Stability Control (ESC)`

`Electronic Stability Control (ESC)` - was one of the first, and most effective, safety systems aimed at preventing accidents happening in the first place rather than, like airbags or seatbelts, reducing the severity of injuries.

It’s so effective it’s been fitted as standard on all new cars since 2014.

Antilock braking systems have been around for a long time and help you maintain maximum braking effort and full steering control in an emergency, without skidding. ESC builds on the capability of antilock brakes.
