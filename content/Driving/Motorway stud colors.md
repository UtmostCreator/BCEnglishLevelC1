Here's a simple mnemonic to help you remember the order of the colors: 

## "Really White And Green" 

1. Really (Red 🟥): Red reflective studs are placed on the left-hand edge of the carriageway. Imagine that you really need to stay on the left side of the road when you see red.
2. White ⬜️: White reflective studs are located between lanes. Think of white as the lines that separate lanes.
3. And (Amber 🟧): Amber reflective studs are on the right-hand edge of the carriageway. Associate "and" with "amber" to remember that it's on the right.
4. Green 🟩: Green reflective studs are used between the carriageway and slip roads. Green can signify "go," which is related to slip roads. 

Red(rly need 2 stay) White(separate lanes) Amber(and) Green(go)
