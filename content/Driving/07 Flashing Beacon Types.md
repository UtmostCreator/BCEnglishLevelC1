The Highway Code makes it clear that motorists should give way to vehicles with flashing lights, including police cars, fire engines, ambulances and emergency doctors. But the new laws are quite clear that when letting emergency vehicles pass, drivers must take appropriate action and continue to obey traffic laws. Itâ€™s important to note that whilst emergency vehicles appreciate drivers making room for them to pass, they donâ€™t want you putting yourself in danger or in fault of the law.

- ðŸŸ©GREEN [no priority] - Doctor on emergency call. Any vehicle used by a medical practitioner registered by the General Medical Council either with limited, provisional or full registration. This grants no privileges or exemptions from traffic laws.
- ðŸŸ§AMBER [no priority] - Unlike blue flashing lights, amber lights grant no priority in traffic andÂ are used to solely to emphasize a vehicle, often due to being a hazard.

- ðŸŸ¥Other than certain emergency response authorities detailed above, red flashing lights are not used on vehicles within the UK. Red flashing lights are not common throughout Europe, though in some countries such asÂ Finland, Estonia, Germany and Sweden, they use a forward-facing red light to indicate that a driver must pull over and stop.


## Often, drivers panic and pull over anywhere to get out of the way. But following the new Highway Code rule, you must avoid carrying out unsafe actions as a driver, or you might face a fine of up to Â£1000.

NEVER pull over or stop in unsafe locations!

- Buses have priority over other traffic in bus lanes, so if you pull into a bus lane, you will be breaking the law and may be subject to a fine.
- Running a red light when an emergency vehicle is approaching can lead to collisions. This can not only cause damage to property, but it can also result in injuries to yourself or to other road users. For these reasons, stay behind the lines at a red traffic light and come to a complete stop when an emergency vehicle is approaching.
- In England, it is against the law to stop in a yellow box junction when giving way to an emergency vehicle. Yellow box junctions are marked with yellow lines painted on the road, and are typically found at busy intersections. The purpose of yellow box junctions is to keep traffic moving by preventing vehicles from blocking the intersection.
- Driving in the wrong direction to make room for an emergency vehicle not only puts yourself at risk, but also other drivers and pedestrians. One-way streets are designed to keep traffic moving in a safe and efficient manner, and driving against the flow of traffic disrupts this flow.
- This obstructs the view of drivers coming down the hill, and they may not be able to see your vehicle until it is too late. It also restricts emergency vehicles from driving, especially if the road is narrow.
- By mounting the kerb, drivers are putting pedestrians, wheelchairs and pram users in danger. This is because it limits the space they have on the pavement and may result in them having to use the road.

For these reasons, it is important that drivers refrain from mounting the kerb when making room for emergency vehicles.

If you do stop in a yellow box junction, you may be liable for a fine.
