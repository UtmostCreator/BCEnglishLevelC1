## how to start your car?

In most modern automatic cars, you should be in the "Park" (P) gear to start the car. This gear locks the transmission and prevents the car from moving, which is a safety measure to ensure that the vehicle remains stationary while starting. Additionally, many automatic vehicles have a safety feature that prevents the engine from starting unless the gear selector is in the "Park" or "Neutral" (N) position. 

> [!NOTE] Best practices
> However, "Park" is generally the recommended gear for starting the vehicle.
## how to move off
1. press and hold the footbrake
2. release the handbrake
3. press little button on gear shifter
4. pull it into D
5. release/come off the footbrake, and the car will start rolling at ~2mph
6. use gas pedal and brake pedal to control the speed
