> **Give Way Rule**: If there is a parked car on your side of the road, yield to oncoming vehicles.

## Collisions

- **Police Involvement**: Police can request your driving license if you're involved in a collision. If there's damage or injury, you must stop.
- **Information Sharing**: You can share the following information in case of a collision: Your name, address, and vehicle registration number.
- **Mandatory Actions**: Stop at the scene of the incident. If you hit a wall or building, inform the police within 24 hours.

## Hazard Warning Lights

- Must be used to warn other users on a motorway.
- Must be used in case of a breakdown and when causing an obstruction.
- Or on an unrestricted dual-carriageway.
- Use it for a moment if there is queuing traffic ahead; it will help alert the traffic behind you.
- When you need to slow down quickly because of a hazard ahead.

## Alcohol

- **Effects of Alcohol**: Gives a false sense of confidence, reduces coordination, and slows down reaction time.

### **MUST NOT** drive with

|                | In England and Wales                                | In Scotland                                         |

| Breath Alcohol | Higher than 35 micrograms/100 milliliters of breath | Higher than 22 micrograms/100 milliliters of breath |
| Blood Alcohol  | More than 80 milligrams/100 milliliters of blood    | More than 50 milligrams/100 milliliters of blood    |

## Long Journeys

Before starting a long journey, make sure that your vehicle can cope with the demands of high-speed driving. You should check the following:
- Fuel
- Oil (it can lead to mechanical breakdown) - the car has a dipstick to check its level or look into your vehicle handbook.
- Water
- Tyres
- Plan your rest stops.

> **Shock Absorbers**: If your car keeps bouncing after you sharply press down and release on the bodywork over the wheel or if your vehicle bounces as you drive around corners or bends, it means that your shock absorbers are worn.
