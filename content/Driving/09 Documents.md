### insurance types

[**Third party**](https://www.comparethemarket.com/car-insurance/third-party/ "Third party") – every driver is legally required to have at least third party car insurance. This covers you if you damage someone else’s car or injure another person. But it won’t cover any injuries to you, or damage to your own car.

[**Third party, fire and theft**](https://www.comparethemarket.com/car-insurance/content/third-party-fire/ "Third party, fire and theft") – this gives you everything you’d expect from a standard third party policy, but also protects you if your car is stolen, or damaged by fire. Fire damage includes deliberate acts, such as arson, as well as accidental fires.

[**Fully comprehensive**](https://www.comparethemarket.com/car-insurance/fully-comprehensive/ "Fully comprehensive") – often referred to as ‘fully comp’, this gives you the highest level of protection. anything even if you are the one to blame
