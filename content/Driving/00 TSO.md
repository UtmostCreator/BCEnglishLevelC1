## using dip and  lights

You must make sure that other road users can see you, but you don't want to dazzle them.
Use your dipped headlights during the day if visibility is poor.
If visibility falls below 100 meters (328 feet), you may use your rear fog lights, but don't forget to turn them off when the visibility improves.
