### what is a 'Blue Badge'?

A 'Blue Badge' in the UK is a parking permit for individuals with disabilities. It allows them to park closer to their destination, making it easier to access essential services and amenities. Here are the key points about the Blue Badge:

#### Eligibility
- **Individuals**: People with severe mobility problems or those who are registered blind can apply. This includes individuals who:
  - Cannot walk or find walking very difficult.
  - Have a severe disability in both arms and regularly drive but cannot operate pay-and-display machines.
  - Have a child under 3 years old with specific medical conditions requiring bulky equipment.
- **Organisations**: Organisations that transport disabled people who would qualify for a Blue Badge individually can also apply.

#### Benefits
- **Parking concessions**: Badge holders can park:
  - On single or double yellow lines for up to 3 hours, unless there's a 'no loading' restriction.
  - For free in disabled parking spaces and some public car parks.
  - At on-street parking meters and pay-and-display machines for free and without time limit.
  
#### Application Process
- Applications can be made online via the official government website or through local councils.
- Applicants must provide proof of identity, address, and medical conditions.

#### Usage Rules
- The badge must be clearly displayed on the dashboard or fascia of the vehicle with the photo side down and details side up.
- It is only valid when the badge holder is driving or being transported in the vehicle.

#### Misuse
- Misuse of the Blue Badge can lead to fines and confiscation of the badge. This includes using the badge without the badge holder being present or lending it to others.

The Blue Badge scheme aims to help individuals with severe mobility issues live more independently by granting them easier access to places they need to visit.
