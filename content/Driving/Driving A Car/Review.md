| Today marks the triumphant day I've passed my driving test, and I'm eager to share my experience for those in search of a true driving instructor<br><br>Prepare yourself for a long, but detailed and unvarnished truth feedback of my journey with Garry Wallace.<br>4 mins to read.<br><br>Today marks the momentous day I venture into the world of driving, thanks to the unparalleled guidance of Garry Wallace.<br>I want to express my gratitude to Garry Wallace, who is an amazing driving instructor who knows everything about how to drive, teach his students, by having all needed materials to get you started either you experienced or novice at driving. With a knack for navigating the complexities of driving and an arsenal of resources for learners of all stripes, Garry's teaching methodology is a step-by-step journey, ensuring no detail is missed. Beyond his instructional prowess, Garry stands as a pillar of patience and calmness, embodying the ideal mentor's temperament.  All attitudes are positive and welcoming and well put which only benefits you to focus and get started with lessons. Encourages and supports you while you learning, all lessons are structured and individualized(is always happy to adapt the teaching style to suit individual learning needs) to your skills and weaknesses which incorporates perfectly in real-world examples, practice, and experience. I am sure you'll find common ground almost immediately. Very understandable person, and always is doing his best. Scheduling lessons is easy and straightforward, you ask about availability, and you are done! <br>Having his knowledge and expertise behind his back and materials at his hands, Garry will guide you through each and every thing you may need to know(maneuvers, marking, road situations, how to act and when). But of course have your own questions and they will be promptly answered with no hesitation. When it comes to communication Garry is considerate, and can either talk to you while you driving or keep silence if it is easier for you (which is i think will be the case when you start driving on roads). But at the same time, if you ask Garry can walk you though from soup to nuts either how to move off using POM(Prepare Observe Move routine), park or do any other maneuvers. Garry are good at giving instruction clear and short, so that you can focus on what you are doing. For example using MSPSL routine, where he can tell you, and direct how to execute this routine in time. Punctuality and professionalism is at another level everything else, never had an issue about moving, cancelling, or rescheduling a lesson. No matter what your situation is, but Garry is open to make everything to keep you happy, if you need to move a lesson for some reason, just contact Garry, and he will see what is possible to do for you.<br>Always on time (of course if the car is secure and safe). Garry is taking care of his car, and is always in a very good condition. Smoke-free car, which is a huge bonus for me (I do not smoke). I like the clutch of Ford Fiesta, it is easy and smooth. Even in a difficult situations, Garry is more than happy to explain, show and give you another shot(either it is a roundabout, junction or anything else you would like to work on). Local knowledge gives you another huge bonus when it comes to knowing the most tricky places in the local area starting from closed junctions (w/ and w/ stop signs), all the traffic lights, roundabouts, Y junctions, crossroads and the roundabouts where you need to use other lanes, and knowledge of where all the signs are, and lots of places for parking, even during the drive, you may notice but something, Garry can bring you so much (maneuvers) in a few minutes, that you may think that you have just had finished the lesson, but actually, you only started! So highly aware of when and where to go during the drive. I find all lessons effective and useful in every aspect. Talking about safety is always the highest priority for Garry, he always makes sure that you are both safe and sound in all situations. I have come though many life situation with Garry in different time of the day, which help me to became more aware of what is happening, you may never expect one thing or another, but it tend to happen, and you are expected to predict it, and it is all experience which you can get only when driving and encounter different situations. After you start, don't be afraid, to text Garry in the app log, what you want to do, and he will bring it to life, so he will know what you want to do, he will find have those places in mind, and it will be even more straightforward and productive lesson. So my verdict is that you won't regret! |     |
