### Pedestrian and Cyclist Priorities
Drivers must give way to pedestrians and cyclists who are crossing or waiting to cross the road at:
- Zebra crossings
- Parallel crossings
- Roads

---

## 1. PUFIN (Spelt slightly wrong - 1 F instead of 2)
**PUFIN** stands for:
- **P**edestrian
- **U**ser
- **F**riendly
- **IN**terface

**Features:**
- **INTELLIGENT CROSSING WITH SENSORS**
- Only stops traffic for as long as necessary
- Can cancel requests if it detects the pedestrian has walked away

### How does it look?

| How does it look?                         | Sensor Placement                                              |

**Zig-Zag marking:** (see description at the end of the page)

![[Pasted image 20230928120658_optimized.jpg]]

### How does it work?

- When the button is pressed, sensors activate to detect the presence of vehicles.
- If a vehicle is detected, the system allows it to pass before changing the light; otherwise, the light may change immediately.
- The sensors regulate the duration of the red light for vehicles, ensuring it remains lit until all pedestrians have safely crossed.

#### Features for Visually Impaired People
- üü© Green light: Cone rotates (safe to cross)
- üü• Red light: Cone does not rotate

#### Traffic Light Sequence

---

## 2. PELICON Crossing (spelt slightly wrong)
**PELICON** stands for:
- **PE**destrian
- **LI**ght
- **CON**trolled

**Major Differences from PUFIN:**
- Not intelligent like PUFIN
- Features a flashing amber light

You might need to wait for 6 to 7 seconds before the light changes, regardless of whether there is a car approaching or not.

### How does it look?

On one side, there is a button; on the opposite side, there is a traffic light.
![[Pasted image 20230928122345_optimized.png]]

#### Rules:
- Flashing amber means allow pedestrians to finish crossing.
- No pedestrians on the crossing: No need to wait for green (you can go when the traffic light is amber).

#### Traffic Light Sequence

## 3. Toucan Crossing (Two-can)
**Toucan** stands for:
- **Two** can cross (Pedestrians & Cyclists)

### How does it look?

#### Traffic Light Sequence

## 4. Equestrian Crossing (aka Pegasus Crossing / Horse Crossing)
### How does it look?

![[Pasted image 20230928135944_optimized.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230928140003_optimized.png]]

- Pedestrian level
- Horse rider level

![[Pasted image 20230928140050_optimized.png]]

#### Black and White Stripes | Belisha Beacon
- Flashing amber light means give way to pedestrians.
- Dotted white line means you **MUST** give way to pedestrians who are:
  - Already crossing
  - Looking to cross the road

![[Pasted image 20230928140202_optimized.png]]

---

## 5. Parallel Crossing (Incorrectly named Tiger Crossings)
A **parallel crossing** is a combined pedestrian and cycle crossing with a priority cycleway, first introduced in the UK in 2015.

---

## 6. Belisha Beacon

A **Belisha beacon** is an amber-coloured globe lamp atop a tall black and white striped pole, marking pedestrian crossings in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and other countries historically influenced by Britain, such as Hong Kong, Malta, and Singapore. The beacons were named after Leslie Hore-Belisha (1893‚Äì1957), the Minister of Transport who, in 1934, added beacons to pedestrian crossings, marked by large metal studs in the road surface. These crossings were later painted in black and white stripes and are known as zebra crossings. Legally, pedestrians have priority over vehicles on such crossings.

## 7. Zig-Zag Lines
### How do they look?

![[Pasted image 20230928140347_optimized.png]]

### Rules

- You **MUST NOT** park üö´üÖøÔ∏è
- You **MUST NOT** overtakeüö´üöîüöò

![[Pasted image 20230928140617_optimized.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230928140706_optimized.png]]

You can use hand signals to indicate slowing down ("***slow down and do not overtake me - I am giving way to a pedestrian***").
