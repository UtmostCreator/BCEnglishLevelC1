Drivers must give way to pedestrians/cyclists those who is crossing / is looking(waiting) to cross the road on
- zebra crossing
- parallel corssing
- road

## 1 PUFIN (Spelt slightly wrong - 1 F instead of 2)
- (**P**edestrian
- **U**ser
- **F**riendly
- **IN**terface)


>Intelligent crossing
>Has sensors
>Only stops traffic for as long as it needs to
>Can cancel requests if it detects the pedestrian has walked away

### How does it look like?

### How does it work?

If the button is pressed, sensors are activated to detect the presence of a vehicle. If a vehicle is detected, the system allows it to pass before changing the light; otherwise, the light may change immediately.

The sensors also regulate the duration of a red light for vehicles, ensuring it remains lit until all pedestrians have safely crossed.

#### Things for visually impaired people

🟩 light - cone rotates (means it is safe to cross)
🟥 light - cone is not rotating

#### Traffic light sequence

## 2 PELICON crossing (spelt slightly wrong)

- **PE**destrian
- **LI**ght
- **CON**trolled

## Major difference from PUFIN

- It is not intelligent (as **PUFIN**)
- **PELICON** has **flashing** amber light

You might need to wait for 6 to 7 seconds before the light changes, regardless of whether there is a car approaching or not.

### How does it look like?

On one side you have a button and on the opposite side you have a traffic light
![[Pasted image 20230928122345_optimized.png]]

#### Rules:
- Flashing amber means let pedestrians to finish the crossing
- **NO** pedestrians on a crossing - **NO** need to wait for green (means you can go when traffic light is amber)

#### Black and White Stripes | Belisha beacon

> when it flashing amber light means give way to pedestrians

Dotted white line - mean you **MUST** give way to pedestrians
- those who is already crossing
- those who is looking to cross the road

## parallel crossing (incorrect name tiger crossings)

A ==parallel== ==crossing== is a combined pedestrian and cycle ==crossing== with a priority cycleway, first introduced in the UK in 2015.

## Belisha beacon

A Belisha beacon (/bəˈliːʃə/) is an amber-coloured globe lamp atop a tall black and white striped pole, marking pedestrian crossings of roads in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and other countries historically influenced by Britain, such as Hong Kong, Malta, and Singapore. The beacons were named after Leslie Hore-Belisha (1893–1957), the Minister of Transport who, in 1934, added beacons to pedestrian crossings, marked by large metal studs in the road surface. These crossings were later painted in black and white stripes, and thus are known as zebra crossings. Legally, pedestrians have priority (over vehicles in the carriageway) on such crossings

### Rules

- u must not park
- u must not overtake
![[Pasted image 20230928140617_optimized.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230928140706_optimized.png]]

You can use hand signals to show slowing down signal (slow down and do not overtake me - I am giving way to a pedestrian)
