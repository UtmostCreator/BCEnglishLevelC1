1 Power Distance

In cultures with high levels of this dimension, subordinates expect to be told what to do. There is a wide range of salaries and perks, which need no further explanation. In cultures with low levels, subordinates and superiors are considered and consider themselves equal. Hierarchies are flat, even with a difference in education level, and salary ranges are relatively small. People aim for the equality of power and demand justification if there is inequality.

2 Individualism vs Collectivism

This is the concept of whether people take care of themselves and their immediate family or whether there is a tightly-knit framework in society. In the former, people believe that individual rights and freedom of speech are very important and encourage personal goals, choices and achievements. In the latter, the individual’s life belongs to the group or society and the individual is valued by the extent to which he serves the group.

3 Masculinity vs Femininity

One side of this dimension is a culture where the gender roles are distinct. Men are supposed to be assertive, tough and focused on material success. Women are supposed to be more modest, tender and concerned with emotions, although they may work and hold down very responsible jobs. In the opposite dimension, both men and women can express their feelings openly and caring for others is a dominant value.

4 Uncertainty Avoidance

For cultures with high levels of this dimension, ‘what is different is dangerous’. There is a greater need for formal rules and less tolerance of people with deviant behaviour. At the opposite end of the spectrum, ‘what is different is curious’, so there is a higher tolerance for ambiguity, and a dislike of unnecessary rules.

5 Monumentalism vs Flexhumility

All cultures preserve links with their past while dealing with the challenges of the present and future. However, this dimension looks at how societies prioritise these goals differently. Cultures scoring low on this dimension like to maintain norms and time-honoured traditions and see societal change as suspicious. Those with high-scoring cultures, have a more pragmatic approach, for example, by encouraging reform in modern education as a way of preparing for the future.

6 Indulgence vs Restraint

This relates to the importance of leisure and the importance of feeling in control of your life. Freedom of expression is also connected to this dimension. At one end of the spectrum, employees are more likely to leave their jobs if they are not happy. At the other end, there is a greater sense of helplessness about personal destiny. An obvious workplace example is how willing employees are to voice opinions and give feedback.

### breaking down into smaller pieces

Sure, let's break down each of these cultural dimensions to clarify what each one represents and how they manifest in societal behaviors and norms:

1. **Power Distance**
   - **Explanation**: This dimension measures the degree to which less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. In high power distance cultures, there is a clear hierarchy, and subordinates are not expected to question the decisions of superiors. This is reflected in large salary differences and distinct perks based on rank. In contrast, in low power distance cultures, there is a push towards equal power distribution and flat hierarchies, where subordinates feel more comfortable discussing and even challenging their superiors, leading to smaller salary discrepancies.

2. **Individualism vs Collectivism**
   - **Explanation**: This dimension focuses on whether people primarily look after themselves and their direct family only, or whether people belong to tightly knit communities. In individualistic societies, there is an emphasis on personal achievement and individual rights, and relationships are often chosen based on personal gain. Collectivist societies value tight social frameworks, loyalty, and group priority over individual desires, with personal identity closely tied to one's group or community.

3. **Masculinity vs Femininity**
   - **Explanation**: This cultural dimension deals with the roles society expects men and women to play. In masculine societies, the focus is on success, power, and competition; men are expected to be assertive and focused on material success, whereas women are expected to be more nurturing and modest. Feminine cultures value caring for others and quality of life, with less differentiation between male and female roles, promoting emotional and caring behaviors across genders.

4. **Uncertainty Avoidance**
   - **Explanation**: This measures how societies deal with the fact that the future is unknown. High uncertainty avoidance cultures feel threatened by uncertain or unknown situations and thus rely heavily on rules, laws, and regulations to mitigate unpredictability. In contrast, cultures with low uncertainty avoidance are more accepting of differences and risk, exhibiting less emotional resistance to change and more openness to unstructured situations and innovations.

5. **Monumentalism vs Flexhumility**
   - **Explanation**: This dimension explores how societies balance respect for historical achievements and traditions with the demands of present and future challenges. Societies with a monumental approach place a high value on maintaining traditional practices and view societal change with suspicion. On the other hand, cultures that score high on Flexhumility are more adaptable, valuing reform and innovation, particularly in areas like education to prepare for future demands.

6. **Indulgence vs Restraint**
   - **Explanation**: This cultural dimension reflects the extent to which societies allow relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun. Indulgent societies permit and promote enjoyment and pleasure, believing it enhances individual and collective well-being. Restraint societies suppress gratification of needs and regulate it by means of strict social norms, leading to a tendency to cynicism and pessimism. 

Each dimension provides a framework to understand the underlying drivers of cultural norms and how they impact behavior in social and organizational contexts.
