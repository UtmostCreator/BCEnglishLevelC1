### Explanation of Dangling Participle

A **dangling participle** occurs when a participial phrase (an adjective phrase that begins with a ***present or past participle***) is intended to modify a noun that isn't explicitly stated in the sentence. This often leads to *ambiguity or a humorous misinterpretation*, as the **participle** appears to be *connected to the wrong noun*.

In the sentence **"Entering the room, the students fell silent,"** the participle "entering" **is meant to modify** "*the teacher*" (the one who is entering), but instead, **it appears to modify** "*the students*." This results in the sentence suggesting that the students were entering the room, which causes the confusion. It is called ***"dangling" because the participle "hangs"*** without a proper subject to modify, ***leaving it unattached or dangling.***
