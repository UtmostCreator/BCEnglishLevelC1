The topic of this lesson is a mini-debate for and against the existence of intelligent alien life in the universe. You will:

- read about scientific arguments for and against the existence of extra-terrestrials
- look at and practise language for taking about probability
- focus on some conditional forms.

## ex7 - Conditional sentences


1. "If the alien life **we were searching** for turns out to be hostile **it would be** better to leave it well alone." (***not exactly what we want to say***)
   - This sentence uses the past continuous tense "were searching," implying that the search for alien life is either hypothetical or has already been completed at the time of speaking. It adds a subtle nuance that the scenario being considered is more speculative or reflective.
2. ***(CORRECT with present conditional)*** "If the alien life **we are searching** for turns out to be hostile **it would be better** to leave it well alone."
   - This version uses the present continuous tense "are searching," suggesting that the search for alien life is ongoing. It indicates a more immediate, current situation.


- If **it is** possible to travel cheaply into space in my lifetime I **might be tempted** out of curiosity
	1. **Present Tense in the "If" Clause**: The present tense here ("is possible") indicates a possibility or potential condition that could realistically happen. It is used to discuss future possibilities based on present facts.
