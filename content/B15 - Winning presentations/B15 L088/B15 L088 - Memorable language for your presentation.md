## ex3 - Using rhetorical questions

#### Asking rhetorical questions is a good way to involve your audience and make your presentation sound more conversational. They can be used at key points throughout your presentation to provoke thought, create anticipation and generate buy-in. Read the strategies here and put the example sentences in the same order:

## ex4 - Checklist for powerful language


**METAPHORS** are usually meant to create a **LIKENESS** or an **ANALOGY**.
A **metaphor** is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn’t literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison.
