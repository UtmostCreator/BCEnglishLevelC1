Getting to know your audience is essential before you can determine how to frame your core and key messages and to select the content. Think about these two audiences. What questions would they want answered?

Then, match the relevant questions to the audience.
**Audience 1** - Senior management (Purpose: To persuade senior management to go ahead with the new product)
**Audience 2** - Sales team (Purpose: To inspire the sales team in how to sell the product)
