| Start with a laugh  | This is a good way to forge an early bond, lighten the mood and signal to the audience they're with someone likeable. Once trust is secured, audiences are more open to your ideas.                          |
| Get personal        | Share a short but relevant anecdote from your own life. It can endear your audience to you and your ideas.                                                                                                   |
| Be self-deprecating | Being a little vulnerable helps your audience feel closer to you. Your honesty helps clear the path to adopting your ideas. Don't go too far though as you don't want to make the audience cringe with pity. |
| Be balanced         | Contrast helps bring focus to key parts of your presentation. Mix humor with a thoughtful insight or data to make it more memorable.                                                                         |
