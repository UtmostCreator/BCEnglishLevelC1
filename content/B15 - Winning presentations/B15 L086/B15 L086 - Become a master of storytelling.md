## ex1 - Storytelling techniques

compelling 
innately
amusement
empathy
secular

Include **details** these help the audience picture it in their heads: like a song that includes one or two details; we automatically fill in the rest of the details in our own heads.

Include **personal facts** most people are innately nosy, whether they admit it or not! In addition, business models are becoming increasingly more personal, and less “serious”, as marketing techniques realise the benefits of making a personal connection with customers.

Include **direct speech** this helps with an audience’s ability to imagine and visualise the scenario being described.

Make sure there is **a problem** that is overcome – this traditional arc engages an audience who become keen to know how the problem will be overcome, and ultimately more satisfied when it finally is.

Include **humour** when an audience smiles or laughs at a story they are connecting with it emotionally, which is more meaningful and memorable. Self-deprecating humour can be very effective: if a presenter talks about how they made a mistake the audience will both laugh in amusement and more importantly in empathy – they too have made mistakes and will warm to someone else’s mistakes for this reason.

Make the story relatable even if it is about an event which hasn’t happened to others, are there elements in the story which will have happened, in some form, to audience members?


## ex2 - Storytelling structures

adversity
triumphant



- The term was first coined by American professor Joseph Campbell and refers to stories where typically a hero goes on a journey into the unknown, faces adversity and conflict and eventually comes back triumphant.

- Highlighting, emphasising and promoting key messages. ⇒ Sparklines
- Demonstrating how you learned something new. ⇒ monomyth
- Grabbing attention from the start. ⇒ In media res

- Inspiring others to action and overcoming business challenges. ⇒ Sparklines


Nehru wrote the book to pay tribute to the rich cultural heritage of India and to **foster** a sense of national pride among Indians during the struggle for independence from British rule.

you can **foster**(implement) your opportunities
Child **fostering**

**secular** nation-state.

Here's a description for each of the terms and how they relate to the corresponding actions:

1. **Sparklines (Highlighting, emphasizing, and promoting key messages)**:
   - **Description**: Sparklines are small, simple charts without axes or coordinates that provide a clear and compact graphical representation of variations in data over time. They are used to highlight trends and patterns in a dataset at a glance.
   - **Application**: In the context of "highlighting, emphasizing, and promoting key messages," sparklines can be employed to visually underscore important data points and trends in a business presentation or report, making key messages stand out immediately to viewers.

2. **Monomyth (Demonstrating how you learned something new)**:
   - **Description**: The monomyth, or hero’s journey, is a narrative framework that involves a hero who goes on an adventure, faces a crisis, wins a victory, and then comes home changed or transformed. It's commonly used in storytelling to describe the journey of a character.
   - **Application**: When explaining how you learned something new, using the monomyth structure can help illustrate your personal or professional growth journey. It shows the challenges faced, the knowledge gained, and how the experience transformed your approach or skills.

3. **In media res (Grabbing attention from the start)**:
   - **Description**: In media res is a literary technique where a story starts in the middle of the action, rather than from its beginning. This method is often used to engage readers' or viewers’ attention right from the start by immersing them in a pivotal moment.
   - **Application**: This technique can be effective in presentations, speeches, or meetings to captivate the audience immediately by dropping them into the most compelling part of your narrative.

4. **False start (Showing the benefits of a flexible approach)**:
   - **Description**: A false start generally refers to an attempt to start something, like a project or initiative, that fails to follow through initially but provides learning opportunities. It's often used metaphorically to describe the early missteps that lead to better strategies.
   - **Application**: Discussing a false start can highlight the benefits of being flexible and adaptive, illustrating how initial setbacks can lead to discovering more effective methods or solutions after recalibrating approaches.

5. **Sparklines (Inspiring others to action and overcoming business challenges)**:
   - **Description**: As previously mentioned, sparklines are effective visual tools that provide immediate insights through simple graphical depictions of data trends.
   - **Application**: When used in the context of inspiring action and overcoming challenges, sparklines can quickly show successes or progress in overcoming obstacles, serving as a motivational tool in business settings to illustrate where actions have led to positive changes and where further efforts are needed.
