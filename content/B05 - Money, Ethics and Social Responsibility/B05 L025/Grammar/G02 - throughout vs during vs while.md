## During + noun - some moments

During the lesson I asked questions (i wasn't asking questions all throughout the lesson - it took me 2-3 minutes out of 60-minute lesson)

We use during to talk about when **something happens in relation to another event** which **lasts for a period of time**. We use a **noun** `after` **during**. Note: we **DO NOT USE DURING** to *talk about the length of time or the start or end point of the event*.

- I went skiing several times during the winter
- I was really bored during the meeting
- **What did you do during the weekend?**

- **Usage:** "During" is used to point out that something happens within a certain period of time. It is followed by a noun or noun phrase.
- **Example:** "During the meeting, I felt unwell."
- **When to Use:** Use "during" when you want to specify the time frame in which something occurs without giving details about the simultaneous actions or events.
- **Limitations:** "During" cannot introduce a clause; it must be followed by a noun or a noun phrase, not a full sentence.

## Throughout + noun - at all moments

> As Scrawny Goat says, don't use **_throughout_** unless you want to emphasise that continuity.

he was stealing money from his employer throughout 2013 (implies the activity was frequent/repeated).

Throughout the lesson, the teacher provided various examples to ensure that every student understood the complex topics being discussed

- _I went skiing several times **during** the winter. (**Maybe** all the skiing trips were at the **beginning** of the winter – **we don’t know**)_
- _I went skiing several times **throughout** the winter. (The skiing trips were **probably** **regular** and **happened for the whole winter season**)_
- _I was really bored **during** the meeting. (**We don’t know** if the speaker was **bored** at the **beginning**, **end**, or for the **whole meeting**)_
- _I was really bored **throughout** the meeting. (The speaker was bored for the whole time the meeting was happening)_
- **Can you practise your hobbies throughout the year or do you need to take a break when the weather is bad?**


- **Usage:** "Throughout" indicates that something happens all the way through a particular period of time or across an area.
- **Example:** "It rained throughout the day."
- **When to Use:** Use "throughout" when you want to emphasize continuity over a period of time or extension over an area.
- **Limitations:** Like "during," "throughout" is followed by a noun or noun phrase. It cannot introduce a clause.

## While (subject + verb) - to talk about 2 actions happening at the same time

We use a full clause (subject + verb) after while so we have a clear picture of both actions.

- I took the kids to school while she was at work
- The phone rang while I was taking a shower
- **Do you listen to music while you are studying?**


The words "while," "during," and "throughout" are used to talk about time, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Understanding their nuances will help you decide which to use depending on what you want to express.

- **Usage:** "While" is used to indicate that two or more activities or situations happen simultaneously. It often introduces a clause.
- **Example:** "While I was reading, the phone rang."
- **When to Use:** Use "while" when you want to focus on the parallel occurrence of events, especially if there's a contrast or an interesting relation between them.
- **Limitations:** "While" cannot be followed directly by a noun. It needs a subject and a verb.


## Main Differences and When to Use Each:

- **While** emphasizes simultaneous actions or events and is used with clauses (subject + verb).
- **During** is used to indicate that something happens at some point within a specific time frame, without implying continuity. It's followed by a noun.
- **Throughout** suggests an ongoing action or presence over the entire duration of a time period or across an entire area, also followed by a noun.

## When Not to Use One Over the Other:

- Do not use **while** when you only need to mention the timing of an event without indicating simultaneous actions. Instead, use **during**.
- Do not use **during** or **throughout** when you need to describe actions happening at the same time; **while** is more appropriate.
- **Throughout** is not suitable for instances where the emphasis is on the specific timing within a period rather than the continuity or entirety of that period. In such cases, **during** is a better choice.

Choosing between these words depends on whether you're emphasizing timing, simultaneous actions, or continuity over time or space.
