> 1. **Indicate the completion of an action** before another action or time in the past. This is particularly useful in complex sentences where the sequence of events matters.

A **perfect gerund phrase** is a grammatical construction that *combines* "**having**" with the **past participle** of a **verb** to *express* an *action* **that occurred before** *another* **action** or **point in time**. In English, **gerunds are verbs** that **function** as **nouns** by adding **"-ING"** to the *base form of the verb*. When **"having"** precedes a verb's **past participle**, `it turns the verb into` a **perfect gerund**, `indicating a completed action`.

The structure of a perfect gerund phrase is:

- **Having** (auxiliary verb) + `[Past Participle of the Verb]` (e.g., having finished, having seen, having been).

### Phrases

- **Having studied** a language you need for a job gives you an upper hand
	- Изучив язык, необходимый для работы, вы получаете преимущество.

- **Having finished** his homework, Tom went to bed. (Here, "having finished" indicates that Tom completed his homework before he went to bed.)
- She regrets **having lied** to her friend. (In this sentence, "having lied" shows that the act of lying happened before the feeling of regret.)
- I am proud of **having been part of** the team. ("Having been part of" indicates the speaker's involvement with the team was complete before the time of speaking.)

### Parts of Speech in a Perfect Gerund Phrase:

- **Having:** Auxiliary verb, part of the gerund phrase construction.
- `[Past Participle of the Verb]:` Acts as part of the gerund phrase, completing the perfect aspect.

Perfect gerund phrases are a sophisticated way to express timing and sequence in English, adding depth to the understanding of when actions occur relative to each other.

## **Perfect gerund structure (passive voice)**: Having + been + past participle

Perfect gerunds in the passive voice are used to describe actions that were completed before a certain point in the past, emphasizing the action rather than the doer. These constructions can be especially useful for expressing experiences, responsibilities, or reflections about past actions that involve the speaker or listener indirectly. Here are some memorable examples that you can use in everyday situations:

1. **"I appreciate having been given the opportunity to work here."**
   - When you want to express gratitude for opportunities provided by others.
2. **"He regrets not having been told the whole story before making a decision."**

## Past perfect vs Perfect gerund

### Key Differences

- **Grammatical Role:** The **past perfect** tense functions as a verb, **showing the sequence of actions in time**. The **perfect gerund** functions as a **noun**, allowing actions to be the subject of discussion or the object of prepositions and verbs.
- **Formation:** Past perfect is formed with "had" + past participle (e.g., had performed), while the perfect gerund is formed with "having" + past participle (e.g., having performed).
- **Context of Use:** **Past perfect** is used within the **narrative(story)** flow of actions to indicate what **happened first**. The **perfect gerund** is often used to **reflect on an action, express feelings or judgments about it**, or describe the cause or effect of an action in a more abstract or general way.
