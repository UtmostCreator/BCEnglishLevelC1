- But how can **working** on the nanoscale make tissue-regeneration more efficient? (a gerund – a verb form which functions as a noun)  
- For an implant to “take”, however, it is also important that the **surviving** bone continues to grow around it ... (part of a present participle clause, functioning as an adjective)  
- They transmit information via microchip about what sort of cells are **growing** around the implant ... (part of the present continuous)


- These issues continue to be problematic, **affecting** huge numbers of people. 
  **part of a present participle clause (functioning as an adjective)** 
  
  Present participles act as adjectives, modifying nouns. In "**affecting huge numbers of people**," "affecting" **describes** "**issues**," *making it adjectival*, and thus a present participle.
- **Ensuring** the implant is accepted and that bone continues to grow and surround the implant is still only half the battle ... 
  **a gerund (a verb form which functions as a noun)** 
  
  Gerunds function as nouns. In "**Ensuring the implant is accepted**," "**ensuring**" is the **subject** of the sentence, performing the role of a noun, hence a gerund.
- In addition, investigators are **developing** nanosensors in order to check on the progress of an implant. 
  **part of the present continuous** 
- This is an area in which nanotechnology is **showing** huge potential. part of the present continuous 
- Unfortunately, these alloys have a lifetime of 10 to 15 years, often **wearing out** within the lifetime of the patient. 
  **part of a present participle clause (functioning as an adjective)** 
- But it seems that silver nanoparticles repel osteoblasts, which would have the effect of **inhibiting** bone growth 
  **a gerund (a verb form which functions as a noun)**

The difference between "**inhibiting**" as a gerund and "**affecting**" as a present participle hinges on their grammatical function in their respective sentences. 
"**Inhibiting**" serves more as a noun (part of the **object** in the clause "the effect of inhibiting"), while "**affecting**" operates as an **adjective** describing "**issues**."


1. Present participle clause acting as an adjective describes ongoing actions affecting people, where "**affecting**" modifies "**issues**."
2. Gerund phrase acts as the subject, showing the action of ensuring as a noun activity, highlighting its importance in the context.
3. Present continuous describes actions in development, indicating ongoing efforts by investigators.
4. Present continuous again is used to describe the current state of nanotechnology, emphasizing its ongoing potential.
5. Present participle clause, similar to the first example, functions adjectivally to describe how alloys wear out, impacting their lifespan.
6. Gerund phrase functions as a noun, describing the action of repelling as an ongoing effect or condition imposed by nanoparticles.
