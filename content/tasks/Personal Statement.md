| I am a software engineer with a master's degree in 'Software Development and Testing.' I am not only passionate about creating and embracing new technologies but also enjoy finding various solutions for a number of different tasks just as I love investigating security issues and breaches. This is what I miss during the software development process as it is not always under the radar for some reason. Some companies may penny-pinch their security during the development cycle, thereby exposing themselves and their valuable clients to incredible danger, and yet another and not less serious issue may come up to the surface when a company will lose not only customers, their trust but also its assets and more trustworthiness from everyone organizations in the world.<br><br>From a young age, I have had a soft spot for programming or doing something with a PC and its software. It has always been a pleasure for me to do something in front of a PC by looking at a wide range of features, and at that point, I thought that I could do more about it to make it work better, prettier, more robust, error-free, and more secure. My passion appeared after I noticed what one of my friends was doing at home, and it caught and kept my attention for quite a while. I was mesmerized and kept looking at the screen while my friend continued creating something I had never seen before. He was looking for a breach in one of his company's web applications as it was his job, to create a well-restrained and secured web application because they stored a lot of important and sensitive information about millions of people. Notwithstanding that, for some people, it may seem far-fetched and daunting, but for me, it only brings more opportunities and expertise, and makes it even more thought-provoking.<br><br>Studying and learning at college and university has given me some opportunities to delve deeper into cybersecurity but not to the extent I need to make sure every software is secure enough so that nobody else can find a way to gain access to any information which is private.<br><br>Even outside classes, I have always been into finding ways the software or a web application can be hacked or hijacked. I know it is possible, though I do have all the ways to do it, and even before I can put forward or suggest any solutions against breaches, I need to know how to go all ways around it. Right now it is my utmost priority to figure out the ways how I can find and solve more issues more efficiently and protectively.<br><br>Now, as a software engineer with more than seven years of experience, can feel that this course must open up new horizons not only as a cybersecurity that I will be undertaking but also as a developer, and having my knowledge behind my back should benefit me even more during the course. I remember having a notification in my email about one of my accounts being accessed and hijacked, so I can be in someone's shoes because I have gone through such a situation, and I can absolutely know what people feel. Another example of a situation can be one of my projects where my client had a huge DB of many users, and because some of its parts were quite outdated, and did not meet the best security practices, unscrupulous people seized the opportunity and managed to gain some of dummy data of a testing server which were luckily only unreal people.<br><br>To sum it up, I can definitely say that If I were to take such a versatile and well-organized course, I would immensely benefit myself in all of my areas of development and security features, and besides that, I am sure that I can develop even more cooperative, individual, and thinker skills in finding and fixing issues related to security and breaches.<br><br>I am eager to take up this course, make new friends, and start networking with more students to share my existing knowledge and gain new experiences and principles of looking into existing issues of any system of any difficulty. | I am a software engineer with a master's degree in 'Software Development and Testing.'
